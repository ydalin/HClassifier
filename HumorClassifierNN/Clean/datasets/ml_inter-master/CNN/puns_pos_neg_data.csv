-1,It was such a shock to learn she had children
-1,We all think it s some kids who are doing this he said

-1,It did not say what could have caused the blast
-1,I am now sure there will be an end to it

-1,They are not learning the survival skills they should be learning
-1,It did not say what could have caused the blast
-1,We re just lucky in this situation that no one was killed

-1,Who can say Not today we don t want it
-1,The movie star told me not to tell you I know it s not fair
-1,It is my disease and I ll handle it my way
-1,I don t think he realized how remote it is he said
-1,I don t have any comment on that she replied
-1,We don t know what the bomb was made of
-1,The poor man didn t really get to do what he wanted to do
-1,Because the procedure has been performed so few times doctors are not sure why the transplant failed
-1,That first patient a 6 year old girl lived only a few hours

-1,If I had one wish it would be that they built the cars in the United States

-1,But I still think there is higher inflation ahead perhaps in spite of this report and not because of it
-1,It s come together over the past year he said
-1,It s a blessing to be a soldier for this country
-1,I don t think I even thought about it but if it had happened it would have just happened

-1,All these years I had been hoping to meet one of those men she said
-1,That first patient a 6 year old girl lived only a few hours
-1,It s very rare to have someone with five good organs

-1,He said it took him two months to read it and then he decided to return it
-1,The librarian said there are no records of who borrowed the book
-1,It is now your turn to sell it on a bargain shelf he wrote
-1,He said it took him two months to read it and then he decided to return it
-1,The librarian said there are no records of who borrowed the book
-1,After that attack was repulsed the military tried again today
-1,The movie star told me not to tell you I know it s not fair

-1,But I want to pursue a career and improve myself
-1,We can stop it in the Senate or we can stop it in the White House
-1,He has to do his own produce his own changes
-1,It was fine with those guys to use it against politicians when they thought it was in their interest he said
-1,You ve got to realize we ve been through this three or four times before
-1,They usually wear no life jackets or other safety equipment
-1,What I want to do is work but there are no jobs at home
-1,He then went out and found her body buried nearby
-1,Some details of the contest are still to be worked out
-1,The couple s son ran to a neighbor who called police
-1,She knew she was going to die said her mother

-1,So I leave as I came dead set against any new taxes
-1,The fighting died down early in the morning he said
-1,Working together we can pass a clean air bill this year
-1,And appearance is what an auto show is all about
-1,There are no test drives and some of the cars can t even be touched
-1,And some people just want to have something new looking he added
-1,The teachers have worked without a contract since July 1
-1,Some people are mad at the school board some are mad at the union and a lot of them are fed up with both he said
-1,He said he came in at 4 a m another day and found too many already in line
-1,There s nothing of what they have promised he said
-1,When he was 4 he and his family left for Cuba where he became a violinist
-1,I m concerned that it s going to wind up being in the best interest of real estate owners and not musicians he said
-1,Many of them died but those who survived still suffer today

-1,My father didn t have anything so I committed this act he said
-1,The church paid for the boy s burial he said
-1,The children and women here are brave too he said
-1,They said they had stopped twice in Cuba for food
-1,I don t know what it is going to be yet we ll see what works
-1,I ve never seen the price of these things go down he said
-1,But water filled the holes about 10 feet under the surface
-1,He said the railroad was in financial straits and human labor was cheap at the time
-1,They said they had no more details about the killing
-1,We are open and here to do the Lord s work
-1,I learned that you don t have to take things lying down
-1,A movie based on the novel was released a year later
-1,In this he saw a chance for a new professional beginning
-1,This was the most difficult book I have ever written he said
-1,It was an effort at self accounting on a scale I had never attempted before
-1,Instead of his usual pace of one film every four years he is making 10 in a space of three years
-1,Americans are always saying that if there is something good you should shoot it immediately
-1,I m surprised no one ever thought of it earlier
-1,I hope it s for good because it set me free
-1,I think they tend to feel that interest rates are already high enough
-1,But I still think there is higher inflation ahead perhaps in spite of this report and not because of it
-1,When I see them with our women my heart boils
-1,Really I just want to go home before things become too much worse he said
-1,I don t know what it was said the man inside the car
-1,We re going to make some changes if for no other reason than that they have to be made
-1,That s probably one reason that we re going on
-1,We d invite her in and even give her a beer
-1,It doesn t worry me so much for people to find out who I am
-1,He also said he stopped drinking two years ago but I ve tried to avoid becoming Mr AA
-1,She returned more than half and had kept the others the report said
-1,I see every man and woman I meet he said once and the women are always good looking
-1,Of course it s hard to lose a sister she said
-1,Some drank tea coffee or other soft drinks in the bar of this country where alcoholic beverages are banned
-1,It makes us look like we re liberal or something
-1,We re out to show them the people do still care
-1,If they have less time for it they just go harder during that time
-1,He said he heard about the killing and his son s part in the murder through the newspapers
-1,We simply don t get the press because for us it s more routine
-1,The post office fire station city hall and a school were all destroyed he said
-1,She said some were in critical condition but did not know how many
-1,He gets angry and violent and that s the bottom line
-1,My wife ran to the back of the house and shouted she could see the left engine on fire
-1,They trade with us only when and if they can t get a better deal from anyone else he said
-1,It measured 5 6 on the Richter scale he said
-1,But Bush has said it can be done and that he will do it
-1,My feeling is let s give him a chance to see if he meant what he said and if he can do what he promised
-1,And when I found myself in the position to make others aware of that or at least try to I was delighted to do so she added
-1,He would likely be put to death or given a lengthy sentence
-1,What it boiled down to was I felt there was a better way to provide electricity
-1,There is not a lot more you can do in a situation like this he said
-1,If increased Would you be willing to pay more taxes for that
-1,Should people be allowed to live on the streets if they want to
-1,We will have to say No when we really want to say Yes
-1,Why would anyone have to murder them or run them down
-1,I m very optimistic the problem will be solved he said
-1,He is in the hospital and he is in serious condition
-1,I am not trying to pass myself off as a woman
-1,I can keep coming up with costumes but I can t take off any more clothes than I ve already taken off he said
-1,How many more ways can I show skin and still be creative
-1,It didn t rain anymore after the tornado so not a lot of homes were water soaked
-1,There wasn t a real tight ring of steel around the town
-1,I think they were trying to make an example of him
-1,I ve been getting calls from all over the country
-1,Marx is even willing to kick in a little extra
-1,I figure I can put my kid through one year of Brown University on this Marx said
-1,That was the only time we ever saw our dad by going to work with him
-1,That was the last I heard from the aircraft he said
-1,That s what kept her so fired up to fight it
-1,There were times we didn t think we were going to get out of there
-1,But he continued Bush has said it can be done and that he will do it
-1,My feeling is let s give him a chance to see if he meant what he said and if he can do what he promised
-1,I just see no reason why we should play it
-1,We ll go on with a certain sense of hope and work at it
-1,All along I have been hoping that I would meet one of them she said
-1,The American people expect better of their political system and they deserve it
-1,But we don t know any more than that he said
-1,It was only seconds away from hitting the center of the community
-1,The United States said the planes were armed and dangerous
-1,If increased Would you be willing to pay more taxes for that
-1,Should people be allowed to live on the streets if they want to
-1,But from what I ve seen over the past few years I think it s necessary
-1,He is in the hospital and he is in serious condition
-1,We simply don t get the press because for us it s more routine
-1,But don t get too excited it s only temporary
-1,If I did marry my husband would have to live next door or across the street because I could never live with someone again
-1,But would a sex life with a mate who lived across the street be complicated
-1,I started getting terrified that any man coming toward me was going to attack me she said
-1,We just happened to know about it this time he said
-1,It will show the United States is not reaching that level either he said
-1,The people would never accept or tolerate anything else he said
-1,If the line breaks gasoline could be spilled leading to a fire
-1,It s true when they say the good die young
-1,He loved my son so much that he had to do this
-1,But she said People don t let themselves be tread on
-1,At home one thing is said at school another she said
-1,But it is a bit too early to say what form that will take
-1,What we should all remember is that it s been 25 or so years
-1,He said government was not the solution to our problems but the problem itself
-1,Then we could all look down and that would make us feel good
-1,But he added In case the meeting isn t held then it must be held as soon as possible
-1,He said the company was determined to force a strike
-1,Those who left could not carry it all with them
-1,We went on flying for a further five minutes he said
-1,It seemed like only five seconds later we were down
-1,I tried to joke about how these things could fly on one engine and glide down he said
-1,I knew if I showed I had any fear she would have been worse
-1,I pulled the emergency exit handle and pulled out the lady next to me
-1,I think I was the third person off the plane
-1,People are already making a big line to fix their papers and leave
-1,They don t think we have to knock somebody off to be a success
-1,He had wanted to be a professor and do research in international relations but said I don t think I want to teach now
-1,I hope to buy them the good things in life
-1,It wasn t a thing where we said Yeah this is a great idea
-1,Now finally the people will be able to say what kind of government they want
-1,What we re interested in is the principle of monarchy
-1,I was going so fast I didn t have time to think about it
-1,She was great she could have said Who is this punk
-1,I think it s good for you to ask What the hell am I doing here
-1,They re paying me a lot of money and I don t know what I m doing
-1,That s part of the fun in a sick little way
-1,We re just here to play a little music not watch me throw up
-1,I thought it would be fun to make a live album with just regular ol musicians playing music
-1,It s more of a treat for people to come here
-1,I played the music I wanted to play and the people that liked it liked it and those who didn t well they re probably better off anyway
-1,I wonder what he would have been like back then and I wonder if I would have even been around with him back then
-1,We weren t afraid of them when they were alive so why should we fear them when they re dead
-1,History cannot be written when our recent past still has a great impact on our present
-1,If someone had told my father he was coming to live in a country that would rule another nation he never would have come
-1,I think it s related to the need to be in control of one s life

-1,All of which raises the question What does it take to put the nation s largest school systems on the road to reform

-1,The report if true would rule out a possible cause of the disaster
-1,We kept asking George to do it over and over again
-1,There won t be any winter or summer White House anywhere
-1,And I d like to see blue collar America have its own castle
-1,He added that he wants them to be on the record as much as possible
-1,If we wanted to do something we would do it
-1,I landed outside picked up my mattress and it was on fire so I tried to put it out he said

-1,He said he d like people to think he d gone on a long trip Arthur Little said
-1,He claimed he s kept in a safe for the past few years
-1,But if I do sell it to someone I d sell it to someone who ll keep it not bust it up

-1,A small bag of crack which goes for 50 in New York can sell for up to 100 here he said

-1,I was just very very happy to hit ground have the plane stop and get off the plane

-1,The men released today said he is still in jail
-1,I want to say I m ready to go let s go he said

-1,But how long this will last I cannot tell you
-1,She really wants to be a wife and mother I think
-1,I ve read as much as I can about her
-1,I didn t point out I have to put up with this all day long out there he said
-1,In his position by doing what he s doing he will draw more attention to it
