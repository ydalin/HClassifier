text:-Well, you guys, today,
President Trump left his summit
with Kim Jong-un early
because they couldn't
reach an agreement.
Yep, he walked out on Kim,
but before he drove away,
Trump rolled the window down,
and he said,
"I just want to take
another look at you."

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Laughter and applause ]
It really seemed
like they were getting along,
but Trump took off before
the summit was finished.
I don't want
to call it a breakup,
but for the whole
20-hour flight home,
Trump was blasting Taylor Swift.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Laughter and applause ]
I heard that Trump
was trying to get Kim
to give up his nuclear program.
Trump was like,
"I offered him a lot --
sanctions relief,
a trade agreement...
Don Jr."

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Laughter and applause ]
"Just take Don Jr.
as an intern."
Yeah,
after hours of negotiating,
Trump just couldn't get Kim
to make a deal.
So between Kim Jong-un
and Nancy Pelosi,
we found Trump's
biggest weakness -- pantsuits.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Laughter and applause ]
Can't handle it.
-Can't handle it.
-It's his weakness.
-Too much.
-But before he flew home,
Trump told reporters
that he could've signed a deal
with North Korea,
but he'd rather do it right
than do it fast.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Or as Stormy Daniels put it,
"That's a first."
[ Laughter and applause ]
Then she laughed so hard,
she blacked out.
[ Laughter ]
Get this --
when Trump left early,
they had to cancel
this big signing ceremony.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:But this was nice -- Kim Jong-un
grabbed all the balloons
and used them to float home
like the kid from "Up."
-Aww.
[ Laughter and applause ]
-It was really touching.
Check this out.
Yesterday was Michael Cohen's
hearing in Congress,
and afterward,
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

her bartending experience

Cohen must have known
about her background,
'cause after she was done, he
tried tipping her in hush money.
[ Laughter and applause ]
Here's some business news.
I heard that Federal Officials

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:are starting to crack down
on fake Amazon reviews.
Yeah, apparently
a lot of reviews on Amazon
are fake or paid for.
Usually, you can tell.
I mean, check it out.
For instance, here's a pair
of Apple AirPods.
The fake review says,
"These have amazing

The real review says,
"These are expensive Q-Tips
that you'll lose instantly."
[ Laughter and applause ]
-That's the real review.
-Yeah.

text:Up next,
here's one for a Fitbit.
A fake review says,

This next one here,
this one's for an Instant Pot.
Review says,
"This is a fantastic way

"Bro, when I ordered
Instant Pot, I was expecting
something totally different."

-"Whaaat?"
-"Like, a chili warmer?
What is this?"
Next up, here's a

Fake review says,

Real review says, "I wake up

[ Laughter and applause ]
[ Grunting ]
And finally,
we have a nose-hair trimmer.
The fake review says,
"I received this as a gift,

[ Cheering and applause ]
How are you?
Joseph, welcome.
Now, Joseph,
can you tell us a little about

text:what we can expect
from this change?
-Of course.
Well, as all New Yorkers know,
for many, many years, the city's
police siren has been this:
Oo-uh! Oo-uh! Oo-uh!
[ Laughter ]
-That's correct, right.
-Or sometimes this:

has been more of a:

-That's right, yeah. I do
recognize that one.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Yeah.
-I do. Yeah.
-But, after receiving literally
billions upon billions
of complaints over the years,
we've decided to try out
a few new sirens, you see.
So, for instance, let's say
someone falls off their bike
into the East River.

text:[ Laughter ]
If you're within a few blocks
of an ambulance,
you might soon hear this:
Ehhhnnn.

-Wow.
So this is a bit
different, then.
-Exactly, yep.
-Little change.

text:Let me ask you:
Have you considered trying
something like this? Like:
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay!
[ Laughter ]
-You know, we did try that.
We tried it, yeah.
It tested a little bit --
It tested decently,
but not nearly as well as:

-See, that's weird because I
wouldn't have guessed that
Uu-eh! Uu-eh! would have tested
better than Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay!

Before their official meeting,
Trump and Kim
spent the day rehearsing of

they both see eye-to-eye.
I mean, Kim has to stand on a
chair for that to happen,
but, still, they do...

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:I saw that when Trump landed,
he was greeted by soldiers
and a red carpet.
I think Trump was confused,
'cause when he
walked the red carpet,
he kept telling all the soldiers
who he was wearing.
He's like, "The suit is
from Men's Wearhouse.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:The wedding ring is fake.
It's fondant.
And the hair and makeup
is by me."
Well, he thought he stepped
onto the red carpet.
Turns out he just
stepped on his tie.
-Really?
-Yeah.
"Oops, sorry."

text:Meanwhile, Kim Jong-un
showed up in an armored train,
because his airplane
is 40 years old.
Yep. His plane is so old,
one guy was like,
"I prefer to ride them
when they're about 18 to 25."
Talking about planes.
-Wow! Airplanes.
-But did you see this?

text:When Kim got out of his train,
his translator was a little
behind and needed to catch up.

flying in from?",
Trump answered, "The sky."

you intend to stay?"

-Let's get to some news,
here, you guys.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Today in Congress,
Trump's former lawyer,
Michael Cohen,
testified about the president
and all his scandals.
Yep. He called Trump a "conman,"
a "cheat," and a "racist."
Trump heard that and was like,
"Great.
Now, I need a new
2020 campaign slogan."

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Laughter, applause ]
"And a new Tinder bio."

That's right.
Cohen went in front of Congress
and called Trump a "conman"
and a "cheat."
Then, he followed it up
by saying,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:"He taught me
everything I know."
[ Laughter, applause ]
But Cohen's testimony
was on every TV channel,

aired on Russian TV.
-Really?
-Yeah.
You know it's crazy when even
Vladimir Putin is like,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ as Putin ]
"Pass popcorn."
[ Laughter, applause ]
"It's getting good.

Cohen discussed what Trump said
about his son, Don Jr.
Watch this.
-Mr. Trump had frequently
told me and others

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:that his son Don Jr.
had the worst judgment
of anyone in the world.
[ Laughter ]
-In response...
Don Jr. was like,
"Dad talked about me?"
[ Laughter, applause ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:"Wow."
And get this -- Cohen also said
that he's responsible
for making sure Trump's
SAT scores never leaked.
[ Laughter ]
It's safe to say the only time
Trump's seen a 1600
is when he passes
the White House mailbox.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Laughter, applause ]
Later on, a Congresswoman
asked Cohen how many times
Trump made him threaten someone
on his behalf.
Check this out.
-How many times did Mr. Trump
ask you to threaten
an individual or entity
on his behalf?

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Quite a few times.
-50 times?

"Double it."
"700 times?"

"Times that by infinity."

"Wow."
During his testimony,
Cohen showed a check that he
says Trump used to pay him back

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:for Stormy Daniels'
hush money.
Take a look at this.
It's for $35,000.
Well, it turns out the president
wrote checks to Cohen
for all sorts of other
expenses, too.
Take a look.
First, Trump wrote a check

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:for a private investigator
to find out who
The Masked Singer is.
-Really?
-He also wrote a check
for taking Don Jr. and Eric
to Six Flags
and leaving them there.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Laughter, applause ]
And finally,
Trump sent a check to Cohen for
"hush money for my barber."
He writes
too many checks.
You guys, Cohen's testimony
was such a big deal
that it completely overshadowed
the summit

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:between Trump
and Kim Jong-un.
You could tell Trump was upset
'cause at one point,
he leaned over to Kim
and said,
[ As Trump ] "How much to
fire off a nuke right now?"
[ Laughter ]
"Don't hit anything."

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Normal voice ] But get this -
I heard Kim Jong-un
actually brought his sister
to the summit.
It got awkward when Trump went
up to Kim's sister and said,
[ As Trump ] "Which one are you,
Khloe or Kourtney?"
[ Laughter, applause ]
[ Normal voice ]
Later on, Trump gave Kim

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:a pretty enthusiastic
handshake.
Check out the way Trump's arm
swoops in there.

a bunch of photos about
his summit with Kim Jong-un
to his Instagram story.

It's when Hollywood
gathers together
to celebrate all
the incredible films nobody saw.
It's great.
[ Cheers and applause ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-These --
These are the jokes?
Unbelievable.
-...limo saying, "I just want
to take another look at you."
[ Laughter and applause ]
Of course, there were some
interesting winners last night.
For example, the Oscar
for Best Animated Short

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Went to Kim Jong-un.
-Oh, really? Wow.
[ Laughter and applause ]
Didn't even know
he was nominated.
-He's very animated.
-Wow.
-Speaking of Kim Jong-un,
later this week,
he's meeting
with President Trump.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:They have a lot in common --
they inherited everything
from their dads,
and they cut their own hair.
[ Laughter ]
That's right --
Trump's going to Vietnam.
-Does he look, uh...
puffy?
-Too much salt.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Ow.
-The meeting's from...
-Let's get all the ramen
out of his office.
-...Trump and Kim Jong-un,
their translator
will just
slowly walk into the ocean.
[ Laughter ]
But I really wish cameras
were allowed in the room

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:for that meeting,
'cause I'd love to see Trump
try to say the phrase
"nuclear prolipf-- prolip --"
Oh, God.
[ Laughter ]
"Nuclear proliferation."
Sorry.
Uh, I wish cameras were there,
allowed in the room
for that meeting, yeah,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:'cause I'd love to see Trump
try to say the phrase
"nuclear polar--"
I can't say it.
[ Laughter ]
I can't say it.
How's he gonna say it
if I can't say it?!
[ Laughter ]
Cut that joke.
We don't need that joke.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Laughter ]
Hey!
Uh...
[ Laughter ]
Five years, five years, yeah.
Some entertainment news --
a new Jean-Claude Van Damme...
-This is
an old person to you, right?

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:This guy looks old?
-"We Die Young"
is about what'll happen
if Trump's meeting if
Kim Jong-un doesn't go well.
-At least he still
combs his hair with a sneaker.
-Get this -- the AARP...
-That's young.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-...reality show
called "Date My Grandma."
[ Audience groans ]
Like "The Bachelorette,"
but instead of a fantasy suite,
they get a booth at Denny's.
[ Laughter and applause ]
-Oh, my God. I hate myself
for writing that joke.
-Yeah, I think we all hate you
for writing that joke.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Yeah. You should quit.
-Mm-hmm.
-Hey, I saw that Facebook
recently celebrated
its 15th anniversary.
I can't believe
it's been around for so long.
Do you remember what it was like
before Facebook?
You remembered
your friends' birthdays

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:'cause you actually cared.
[ Laughter and applause ]
Bang.
[ Rimshot ]
[ Laughter ]
Before Facebook, you spent time
at work actually working.
[ Rimshot ]
Before Facebook,
the only way to find out

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:your uncle was racist
was seeing him on Thanksgiving.
[ Rimshot ]
Finally, you guys,
a new report found
that the New York Knicks
are the NBA's most valuable team
at $4 billion.
That's crazy.
That's a billion dollars
for every game

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:they've won this year.
-Well, guys, earlier tonight
President Trump
gave his first ever prime-time
address from the Oval Office.
He would have done it
last night,
but he knew interrupting
"The Bachelor"
would get him impeached.
[ Laughter ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:That's right.
Trump went on TV to make
the case for a border wall.
But it got weird when he held up
a picture of the wall and said,
"And it could all be yours
for five easy payments
of $1 billion."
[ Laughter ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:This week the White House
was caught several times
making up statistics
about the border situation.
[ Audience ohs ]
In response Trump said,
"That is a lie, and 150% of
people agree with me."
[ Cheers and applause ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Well, Trump's address aired on
all the major networks,
including NBC, CBS, ABC,
and even Telemundo.
[ Laughter ]
Later on when Trump
saw his speech
dubbed in Spanish on Telemundo,
he had himself deported.
[ Laughter ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Very interesting.
But this is interesting.
Trump's prime-time address
actually had some sponsors.
-Really?
-Check this out.
-Tonight's presidential address
is brought to you by Taco Bell.
The President calls us
"Mexican McDonald's."

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:And Jack Daniel's.
Start drinking now if you want
this speech to make sense.
-That's interesting, right?
-Wow.
-Well, after Trump's speech
about his border wall,
the Democrats
were given the chance
to deliver an official response.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:But instead
they just sent this gif.
[ Laughter ]
I saw that earlier today
Vice President Mike Pence
went on three different
morning shows to build support
for Trump's border wall.
And in each interview
he made sure

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:that he stuck to his script.
Watch this.
-President Trump is prepared to
do what's necessary
to address what is a real
humanitarian and security crisis
at our southern border.
Until the Democrats in Congress
come to the table,
the situation on
our southern border has become,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:as "The Washington Post" said,
a bona fide emergency.
[ Laughter ]
-People said, "That's creepy."
And Alexa said,
"I am so turned on right now."
[ Laughter ]
Of course, today was the 18th
day of the government shutdown,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:and I heard that
Secret Service agents
have been working without pay.
Trump knows that they're mad
at him 'cause when he walks by,
they go,
"Barf Bag is on the move."
[ Laughter ]
That's right. The government
shutdown is in its 18th day.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:And I saw that some members of
Congress are starting to
pick up part-time work
while they're out of a job.
I'll show you what I mean.
Senator Roy Blunt got a job
as the president
of the lollipop guild.
-Wow.
[ Laughter ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Senator Angus King got a job
as the sheriff in a town
that doesn't allow dancing.
[ Laughter ]
-Really?
-It's forbidden.
-Wow.
-Senator Lindsey Graham
got a job

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:as an Applebee's waiter
that's a little too chatty.
[ Laughter ]
"Hey, y'all,
who want some apps?"
Senator Tom Carper got a job
as a gravedigger
from a "Goosebumps" book.
[ Laughter ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Senator Chris Coons got a job
as an assistant gravedigger
from a "Goosebumps" book.
[ Laughter ]
And finally, Senator
Mitch McConnell got a job
as a smiley French fry.
[ Laughter and applause ]
-Wow.
-You got to work.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-You got to work, man.
-You got to work.
Work!
Some more news.
I saw that today was
North Korean leader
Kim Jong-un's 36th birthday.
And in the past year
he's become friends with Trump,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:so the president sent him
a special birthday greeting.
Check it out.

"The Bachelor."
[ Cheers and applause ]
I love it.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:We got to meet all
of the contestants,
and one of them used
a pretty interesting strategy
when she met Colton.
Watch this.
-Colton. What's your name?
-Bri.
-Bri.
-So nice to meet you.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Nice to meet you.
You got a nice accent.
Where you from?
-The accent is Australian.
I was hoping that you were kind
of a sucker for accents.
-I am.
-I don't know what you think
about it.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-I love it.
I'll see you inside, all right?
-Okay, sounds good.
I'm not really Australian,
but you have to do what you can
to stand out.
[ Laughter ]
-What?!

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:What?!
-It got weird
when the next contestant
he met was like,
"It's a me, Mario!"
[ Laughter ]
That's right.
Everyone was trying to make
a big first impression,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:and one of the women
even showed up in a costume.
Check this out.
[ Laughter ]
-Yeah.
Then the fake Australian lady
was like, "Crikey, she's crazy."
[ Laughter ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Hey, I heard that this year,
a lot of people are
participating in Dry January,
where they give up drinking
for the entire month.
-That's right, Jimmy.
No booze until February.
-Hey, that's great, Tariq.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Yeah, I'm living
that clean lifestyle.
-Keep it up.
-New year, new me.
-Good for you.
-I don't need it.
Don't want it. Don't miss it.
-Sounds good.
-It's a tipple-free Tariq.
[ Laughter ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-We got it.
-Because you booze, you lose,
right?
[ Laughter ]
-Good for you.
-Got no time for the wine.
[ Laughter ]
-I got it.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-I said goodbye to rye.
[ Laughter ]
-Understood.
-Quit beer, have no fear.
-Yep.
-I'm getting frisky,
just without the whiskey.
[ Laughter ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Tariq, are you drunk right now?
-No, no, I'm just really high.
[ Laughter and applause ]
-Come on, wow!
-And finally, I read about
a 94-year-old woman in Utah
who is Arby's oldest employee.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:When asked what it's like to
work with her, the manager said,
"Oh, thank God.
You can see her too?"
We have a great show tonight.
Give it up for the Roots,
everybody.
-Well, you guys,
today most of the country
got hit with a big winter storm.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:And even Washington, D.C.,
got a few inches of snow.
Yeah.
This morning, Trump got excited
'cause when he looked outside,
he thought he woke up in Russia.
[ Laughter and applause ]
"It came true!
I'm a real boy."
[ Laughter ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:That's right,
even Washington got snow.
I guess the blizzard formed
when God said,
"You want to see
a national emergency?
I'll show you a national
emergency, all right?
Boom!
There you go."
[ Applause ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:But early reports
said Washington
got between 2 and 4 inches.
Yep, it's the same report
Stormy Daniels got
before meeting Trump.
-Hey-o! Hey!
Hey, what?!
-Wait a second.
-What?!

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-What?!
-What?!
[ Laughter ]
Come on.
-Speaking of the President,
I heard that he's already
trying to come up with nicknames
for his 2020 opponents.
Like Bernie is Crazy Bernie.
Joe Biden is Sleepy Joe.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Laughter ]
Trump was like, "I'm so good
at making up nicknames.
That's why I call myself
Good Nickname
Maker-Upper Donald."
[ Laughter and applause ]
That's right. Trump's trying
to think of nicknames

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:for all the 2020 Democrats.
I guess that's why Trump's
last Google search
was for
the Wu Tang Name Generator.
[ Laughter and applause ]
Oh, and I read that Trump is
already hiring extra staffers
for his 2020 campaign,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:which is sort of like
finding out
you're being picked to put
together the next Fyre Festival.
[ Laughter and applause ]
-Oy!
Boink!
-Listen to this --
in a speech today,
Vladimir Putin said Russia would
use its new hypersonic missiles

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:that can fly nine times
the speed of sound.
Yeah, of course,
if he targets New York,
they'll still have to circle
over LaGuardia for a few hours
before they can strike.
We all know.
[ Laughter and applause ]
Check this out --
at an event last night,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:former President Obama said,
"If men are confident
about who they are,
they don't need eight women
around them twerking."
[ Laughter ]
Then Joe Biden was like,
"All right, ladies,
I think you should go home."

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Laughter and applause ]
Hey, guys,
the Oscars are on Sunday.
[ Cheers and applause ]
And I saw that "Roma"
could become
the first foreign-language film
to win Best Picture.
Unless you count Bradley Cooper
talking in "A Star is Born"

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:as a foreign language.
[ Laughter and applause ]
[ Grumbles incoherently ]
[ Laughter ]
I think you're beautiful.
[ Laughter ]
Get this -- I read that each
gold-plated Oscar statue

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:is only worth $400.
That's pretty crazy.
If someone offers you
an Oscar or an Apple Watch,
you actually have to stop
and think about it.
You're like, "Ah, ah."
Oh, this isn't good.
Guys, today,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Southwest had to cancel
hundreds of flights
due to mechanical problems.
Yeah, the CEO of Southwest
was like,
"I'm sorry, but two wings seemed
pretty freaking redundant."
[ Laughter and applause ]
This is crazy.
The other day, strong tail winds

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:caused a commercial flight
from L.A. to London
to go faster
than the speed of sound.
Yeah.
The pilot was like,
"On your left
is the Hollywood sign,
and on your right
is...Buckingham Palace?"
[ Laughter and applause ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Check this out.
I read about a vegan woman
who recently got married
and banned all meat-eaters
from her wedding.
Then her friends and family
were like,
"Oh, no, we're not allowed
at your vegan wedding?
Oh. Bummer."
[ Laughter, cheers, applause ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:"Wow!
So sorry to hear that.
Yeah, hopefully
we can get together soon, yeah."
[ Laughter ]
"That sounds like fun.
Yeah, sorry."
[ Laughter ]
And finally, listen to this.
After a guy in Dallas

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:finished last place in his
fantasy football league --
Did you hear about this?
He had to go to a dog park
covered in peanut butter.
[ Audience groans ]
His friends laughed,
then got concerned
when he went back again
the next day.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:"Wait, wait.
What's going on?"
[ Laughter and applause ]
-You guys, this Sunday
is the 91st Academy Awards.
Yeah. 91.
91 is old for an awards show.
But it's young if you're a
Democrat running for president.
You know what I mean?
We got to remember that.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:I saw that Bradley Cooper
and Lady Gaga
are performing their hit song,
"Shallow," at the Oscars.
[ Cheers and applause ]
That's great.
In case you missed
hearing it at the Grammys,
Golden Globes,
SAG awards, YouTube,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:and every radio station,
you'll be able to see it
on the Oscars.
But everyone's excited
about the Oscars.
It's that night when
all the biggest movie stars
put on expensive clothes,
spend half the day
getting their hair
and makeup done,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:sit through a four-hour show,
and then say,
"Awards don't matter."
It's just fantastic.
Isn't it great?
Get this. In a new interview,
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
was asked about the Oscars.
And he said he loves
the band Queen.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Which is good,
'cause "Bohemian Rhapsody"
could really use
that extra Mike Pompeo bump
right before Sunday night.
He can really push it
over the edge.
But, you guys,
the Oscars will be broadcast
all over the world
in over 100 countries.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:And I read that Russian
President Vladimir Putin
is actually a big movie fan.
-Really?
-Yeah, he even puts out
his own reviews
of the films
that got nominations.
For instance, for the movie
"Mary Poppins Returns,"
Putin wrote, "Usually when
someone disappear for so long,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:they do not return."
[ Laughter ]
-Wow.
-So he's 50/50 on that one.
-Yeah. Chilling.
-Next, for "Green Book,"
he wrote,
"I prefer book
with more beautiful color

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:like gray or dark gray."
[ Laughter ]
Gray.
-Wow. Those are his two colors?
-That's his two colors.
-Gray or dark gray.
-Finally, for "A Quiet Place,"
Putin wrote,
"Was still louder than most
Russian birthday parties."

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:They're not that loud.
-It's very quiet.
-Let's get to some news
here guys.
Today President Trump tweeted
that he wants the U.S. to have
5G and 6G data networks.
I really don't think
he knows what he means.
When asked to explain, he said,
"Ain't nothin' but a G-thang."

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:And you go,
"What are you talking about?"
Guys, I heard that this spring
Trump's heading to Japan.
-Oh.
-Which means we're just
three months away from seeing
the President of the United
States dip his sushi in ketchup.
So get ready for that.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Get ready for that
to be embarrassing.
"I think this is raw.
Send it back.
I'm sending it back
to the kitchen."
Check this out.
A new article says that Trump
loves talking to lawmakers
on the phone day and night.
But it gets awkward
when the conversation ends,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:and he starts going,
"You hang up. No, you hang up.
No, you hang up first.
No. Oh, okay."
Some more news --
Beto O'Rourke hasn't ruled out
being a vice-presidential
candidate in 2020.
And some people want him
to be Joe Biden's running mate.
Can we see them together? Yeah.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:That looks like a game-show host
at the beginning and end
of his career.
[ Cheers and applause ]
"Come on down!"
Can we see them again?
They look like --
[ Laughter ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:They look like a father and son
who have their own
dental practice.
"Very proud of him.
Very proud of my boy."
[ Laughter ]
Here's a big -- Oh, I love you.
Here's a big sports story, guys.
Last night, Duke played
North Carolina in basketball.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:But the best college player

had to leave the game
after 30 seconds
'cause his Nike sneaker

It fell in two pieces.
Like, watch -- Look at this.
-Zion Williamson is down.
-You see that?
-He blew through his shoe.
-Look at that.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Look at his --
-Wow.
-That's unbelievable.
-I mean, can we see the sneaker?
[ Laughter ]
I mean, what --
I guess that explains Nike's
new slogan -- Just Glue It.
[ Laughter ]
-Oh!

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Well, after it happened,
Nike's stock actually went down.
-Really?
-Yeah, their CEO was furious.
He went into the factory
and said,
"Come on! What am I paying you
five cents for?!"
[ Audience groans ]
Oh, really? Like you don't know?

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Oh, stop! Are we all acting?
Okay. We're all acting?
Okay, fine.
I didn't know
we were all going to act.
Okay. It doesn't happen. Okay.
-Indeed!
-It doesn't happen. Yeah.
Some more sports news.
Please.

text:You know your brain
is laughing at that joke.
It's fine.
Some more sports news --
the San Diego Padres
are signing shortstop
Manny Machado
to the biggest baseball contract
ever, worth $300 million.
They told Manny,
"We're so excited to have you,"

their other players,
"We're gonna have to let you go.
I'm so sorry. We have no money
to pay for anyone.
It's the Manny show."
Hey. Listen to this. Google
forgot to notify customers
that it put microphones
in its Nest security systems.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:When asked if customers
were upset, Google said,
"Yeah, they sound upset."
[ Laughter ]
It wasn't in the thermostat,
though, right?
-No. They're, like,
in the security thing.
-What are you talking about?
What do you think they're doing?

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-You know they listen to you.
-What are they're gonna be like?
"Oh, they saw everything.
I didn't want them
to hear anything."
[ Laughter ]
If it was a thermometer,
I'd be like,
"Oh, my God. They put a
microphone in the thermometer."

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:But it's in the camera that
you're recording yourself with?
-I think so.
-Well, what are they recording?
What is the security for?
Intruders? So people outdoors?
So they can hear what's
happening outside your house?
What's the problem?
It's outside.
People are going to hear
what's happening outside.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Hey, what happens outside
stays outside.
-No, I'm not saying that.
I'm not saying that.
-Hey, I understand
what you're saying.

-I don't know
what language that is.
But I -- No, I don't --
I don't do anything in my house
or outside my house.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Sure!
-But if I'm gonna get a camera
from a company, a video camera,
I hope it has a microphone.
-Yeah.
-Everything has
a microphone, right?
My TV knows what I'm doing.
My phone. Everything.
-Everything. They know
where you are at all times.

I didn't catch that.
-I'm sorry. Thanks.
Turn my phone off.

-My bad.
-Bleep, blorp!
-And finally, guys, get this.
Two dentists in Virginia were
caught giving free dental work

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:to people who agreed
to be their drug mules.
Police got suspicious
when they saw several meth heads
who still had teeth.
-Well, you guys,
we're less than a week way
from President Trump's
big summit
with North Korean leader
Kim Jong-un,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:and I read they're expected
to have a very private meeting.
Yeah, the room will
just be Trump, Kim,
and Kenny G
playing the saxophone.
-Oh.
[ Laughter and applause ]
-But the two of them
are meeting in Vietnam,
and I heard Kim Jong-un
is expected to arrive by train,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:while Trump
is expected to arrive
by Thomas the Tank Engine.
It should be fun.
He should do that.
And this is interesting.
I read that Trump
and Kim Jong-un

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:have been exchanging
letters and gifts.
Yep. Trump sent Kim
Rosetta Stone English,
while Kim sent Trump
Rosetta Stone English.
And it's --
-Oh.
-Interesting.
Actually, instead of a gift,
Trump told Kim,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:"A generous donation has been
made in your name to the wall."
[ Laughter and applause ]
Listen to this --
The FBI's former deputy director
says Trump used to ignore
intelligence reports.
And now people
are saying that Trump
might fire his National
Intelligence Director.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:That's not good.
I mean, just --
just look at how Trump answered
some basic questions
on U.S. intelligence.
When asked, "Who is our
country's greatest ally?"
Trump said, "Wakanda."
[ Laughter and applause ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:When asked, "Does Kim
have nuclear warheads?"
he said,
"No, but she has Kanye."
[ Laughter ]
-I can't believe it.
-And finally, they asked,
"What is the CIA?"
His answer was, "That woman
who sings 'Chandelier'

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:and doesn't show her face."
That's Sia.
The whole thing is --
Come on, man.
Read the reports.
-It's crazy.
-Guys, the Academy Awards
are this Sunday.
Are you excited for that?

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Cheers and applause ]
I saw that this year's
Oscar stage is all gold

Which makes sense
when you find out
this year's theme
is Trump's bathroom.
"Very classy,
very classy commode."

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Light laughter ]
Check this out, guys.
A sneaker company
just started selling
avocado-toast-themed shoes.
Take a look at this.
Wow!
[ Laughter ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Ahead of its time.
It's almost ahead of their time.
You know what I'm saying, dude?
Actually, if you don't wear
the avocado shoes right away,
they start looking like this.
And I hate when that ha--
That's just terrible.
I hate when that happens.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Finally, a new study found that
women who have more children
actually age more slowly,
while women who have no children
couldn't take part in the study
'cause they were busy having
the time of their lives.
[ Cheers and applause ]
If you guys wouldn't mind,
I'd just like

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:to write out my weekly
thank-you notes right now.
Is that cool with you guys?
[ Cheers and applause ]
James, can I get some
thank-you-note-writing music,
please, James?
[ Piano plays ]
Thank you, Amy Klobuchar,
for eating a salad with a comb

That's one the kids can tell.

Welcome to the show, everybody.
Well, the results of Trump's
annual physical came out.
And I saw that in the past year,
he gained 4 pounds.
Trump said, "That's because
when I stepped on the scale,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:I forgot to take off my hair."
4 pounds?
After gaining 4 pounds,
he's now technically
considered obese.
He knew he was in trouble
when he got on the scale,
and it said
"National Emergency."

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:That's right -- Since Trump
is now technically obese,
he could just
BE the border wall.
That's what I'm saying. Why not?
I saw that one of
Trump's challengers
in the next election,
Kamala Harris,
says she supports
legalizing weed,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:because it gives
a lot of people joy.
[ Cheers and applause ]
Which explains her new slogan...

We've got a great show tonight.
Give it up for The Roots,
everybody.
You guys, last night we had
our big show in Puerto Rico.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:And I'm happy to report the
island is open for business,
while our government
still is not.
That's right.
The federal government
has been closed for 26 days,
and experts say the shutdown
could cause the economy
to shrink.
Then the President said,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:"No, it's only shrinking
'cause it's cold outside."
[ Laughter ]
Well, today,
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said
that due to the shutdown,
Trump should postpone
his State of the Union address
or do it in writing.
Which explains why Trump
just asked Twitter

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:to raise the character limit
to 50,000 words.
[ Laughter and applause ]
A lot of people are calling
Pelosi's decision
a real power move.
Even Vladimir Putin was like,
"Damn. She is not here
to make friends."

But despite the shutdown,
the FDA is trying to restart
their inspections
of risky foods,
though so far
it's just one guy going,
"Does this smell bad to you?
Try it. Drink it."

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:And the CEO of Delta said
the shutdown has already cost
the airline $25 million.
He's not that worried,
because they'll make it all back
if two people pay
to check their bags, so...
"We're back!
-"Come on. We're back.
-We're back, baby!"
-Come on!"

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-But Trump's been upset
with how the media
has covered the shutdown.
And this week, he tweeted
that the fake news
needed to "chill."
Yeah, well, here's what
three different news networks
were covering at the
exact same time this morning.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Let's see if any of them took
Trump's advice about chilling.
-All of these tributaries
are going to come rolling
into the same place --
Russia, Mueller,
stuff we don't even know about.
-The damage
being done to the economy
is worse than they predicted.

text:-But you can make a snowman

text:As I mentioned, last night,
we had our Puerto Rico show,
but that meant we missed
something pretty incredible
that happened in the news.
I'm talking about
President Trump buying fast food

Trump bingo.
Oh, later --
and this is weird --
CNN used that same graphic,
but they were also able
to show Trump's reaction.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Check this out.
-Here's what we do know that is
under investigation right now --
The Trump Organization,
the Trump Foundation,
the Trump campaign,
the Trump inauguration,
and the Trump administration.
[ Laughter ]
-Amazing, right?
[ Applause ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Wow!
-Wow!
-[ Laughs ]
-That's right.
Trump is dealing
with several scandals right now,
but he tweeted
that the real scandal is, quote,
"unfair news coverage."
And -- And, so, this is real.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Here's what three different
networks were covering
at the exact same time
this morning --
at 7:01 a.m. this morning,
three different networks --
here's what they were covering.
Let's see if he has a point.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Just 34% believe the President
is being honest and truthful.
♪♪
-The Trump campaign,
the Trump transition,
the Trump administration,
the Trump charity,
the Foundation --
all of those
are under investigation.

-Bacon bits

[ Laughter ]
-Uh, those are actually bacon.
[ Laughter ]
-Bacon bits are suing him.
[ Applause ]
I -- Looks fair to me.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:I don't know
what this problem is.
You guys hear about this?
Mick Mulvaney has agreed
to become
Trump's Acting Chief of Staff,
but says that he only wants
to do the job for six months.
You can tell
working for Trump is tough
because people are quitting
before they even start.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:It's like,
"Yeah, I'm going to quit, so...
I'll take the job, but I'm out.
No way."
[ Applause ]
Well, as I mentioned,
Christmas is next week,
which means a lot of people
are shopping online
for the holidays.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:It turns out that many websites
have actually suffered
security breaches.
In fact, some of our audience
members tonight were hacked,
so we were able to find out
what that they bought this year.
I thought I'd show you at home
what a few examples are.
So, this person right here,
for example, he...

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Laughter ]
...he bought
a couples massage for one.
I mean, what is that?
[ Cheers and applause ]
This...
This person --
she bought
a laser tattoo removal

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:because it's a long story.
[ Laughter ]
I don't want to know.
I don't want to know.
This person here -- she got
noise-canceling headphones
"so, on the ride home,
I don't have to listen
to the person I came here with."
[ Laughter ]
That is so rude!
That's your friend!

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Applause ]
This person here bought
the "Fifty Shades of Grey"
audiobook collection.
[ Laughter ]
Ooh, la, la!
Just read it, for God's sakes.
[ Applause ]
Look at this person -- this
person here bought a work bong.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:What does that even mean?
-A work bong?
[ Laughter ]
-What is a work bong?
[ Applause ]
This person here bought
a 24-pack of denim underwear.
I didn't even know
that's a real thing.
[ Applause ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:And finally, this person bought
Viagra, but for a friend.
[ Laughter ]
And there you go, everybody!
We have a great show tonight!
Give it up for The Roots!
[ Cheers and applause ]
-You guys, I hope you're all
enjoying New York City.
Today, it was 45 degrees
and slightly breezy,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:or as the President
calls that,
[As Trump] "a national crisis."
[ Laughter ]
[ Normal voice ] That's right,
Trump spoke last night
about the border,
and in his speech,
Trump criticized Democrats,
insulted immigrants,
and said we need a wall.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:By the end, anyone playing
a Trump drinking game
was like, "Call an ambulance.
Uh...
You're my best friend.
I hate you."
[ Laughter and applause ]
Most people said that Trump
didn't say anything new.
He just repeated what he's
been saying for years.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:In other words, Trump's speech
was like
every phone call with your dad.
[ Laughter ]
"Lock your car door twice,
and..."
Well, I don't know
if you watched the speech,
but the very first thing Trump
said sounded a little Italian?
Listen to this.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-My fellow Americans, tonight, I
am a-speaking to you.
[ Laughter ]
-Can -- Can we hear that again?
-Tonight, I'm a-speaking to you.
[ Laughter and applause ]
-[As Trump] I want-a
build-a the wall.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Laughter ]
And Mexico will pay the money.
[ Cheers and applause ]
That's-a right.
It's-a me -- a-Trumpio.
[ Normal voice ] Even Anthony
Scaramucci was like,
[ As Scaramucci ] "Can you
believe this freakin' guy?"
[ Laughter and applause ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Normal voice ] A lot of people
noticed how close the camera was
to Trump
during his speech.
To put it in perspective, here's
how Oval Office speeches
normally look.
And now here's Trump's.
[ Laughter ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:They had to crop out
all the resignation letters
on Trump's desk,
I guess is what it is.
[ Applause ]
But I read that Trump's staff
was very happy with the speech
and thought he was
calm and controlled.
Then, Melania was like,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ As Melania ] "I crushed up 20
Benadryls
and put them in his food."
[ Laughter ]
[ Applause ]
[ Normal voice ] I saw
that during the speech,
protesters outside
the White House
held up a giant sign
that said "fake crisis."

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Check this out.
Is it -- Yeah.
Of course, Trump was looking
at that sign
from the opposite side,
so he was like, "Sisirc ekaf?"
[ Laughter and applause ]
"Adele dazeem?"
[ Laughter ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Well, after Trump spoke,
Democratic leaders
Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer
delivered a response.
And a lot of people are talking
about how creepy they looked
standing next to each other.
[ Laughter ]
Check it out right there.
Look at that.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Laughter ]
Oh, my gosh.
They look like extras
from the movie "Get Out."
Uh, they...
[ Laughter ]
[ Applause ]
They look...
They look like two defendants
on "The People's Court."

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:That's how your parents look
when you try to tell them
about the benefits of CBD oil.
[ Laughter and applause ]
[ Chuckling ]
Look at Chuck Schumer.
He looks like he's wearing
a Chuck Schumer mask.
[ Laughter ]
Some more news --

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:In a tweet today, Trump
talked about forest fires.
But he spelled the word "forest"
wrong twice.
Take a look at this. Yeah.
[ Laughter ]
[ Audience groans ]
I guess you can add spellcheck
to the list of things
that are shut down.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:It's like...
[As Trump ] Oh...
[ Laughter and applause ]
"Forest?"
I spelled "fires" right.
[ Light laughter ]
[ Normal voice ]
You guys see this?
All week, the Internet
has been going nuts
over this app called Twinning,
where you upload a photo,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:and it shows you
your celebrity twin.
Okay, yeah.
So, for example,
if I load this selfie
from my Instagram,
I get an 83% match with myself.
[ Laughter ]
-83%?
-83%.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-That's pretty good.
-83%, it looks like me.
-Yeah.
[ Light laughter ]
-It's a weird picture
of me, too.
I don't even remember --
When did I have a beard?
I have no idea what's going on.
-Yeah.
-Well, everyone's been using it,
even some political figures.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:I'll show you what I mean here.
First up is Mike Pence.
The app says that his twin
was Eminem.
[ Laughter and applause ]
-Wow.
-Cool.
-Yeah.
-Next up, there's
Senator Elizabeth Warren.
The app said her twin was Barb
from "Stranger Things."

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Laughter ]
I miss Barb!
-Wow.
-Where's Barb?! I miss Barb!
She should have
her own spin-off.
Here's White House
Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney.
His twin was Scooter
from the Muppets.
[ Laughter and applause ]
-Oh!

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Up next, there's Eric Trump.
His twin was
the bad guy from "Aquaman."
[ Laughter and applause ]
And finally,
we have President Trump.
His twin was a yam.
Oh, interesting.
[ Laughter and applause ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:You guys hear this?
Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos
and his wife are splitting up.
[ Audience groans ]
But on the bright side,
he has a lot of extra boxes
to pack his things up.
[ Laughter and applause ]
And finally, I heard
that Denver could become

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:the first city in America to
decriminalize magic mushrooms.
They're the first ones
to realize
that the only way Americans
will eat vegetables
is if they're also drugs.
[ Laughter ]
We have a great show tonight!
Give it up for the Roots!
-Let's get to some news.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:It just came out
that President Trump
still uses his personal,
unsecured cellphone,
which lets China and Russia
listen to his calls.
Americans were shocked.
They were like,
"You guys actually
want to listen to Trump?"
[ Laughter ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Did you read this?
A new article says
the White House staff can't get
Trump to stop using his iPhone.
But they have a plan
to make him get rid of it.
They're gonna change his
wallpaper to the Mexican flag.
And then that should --
That should stop him.
But in the article,
officials said Trump

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:isn't spilling secrets
on the phone
'cause he doesn't read enough
intelligence reports
to know any.
[ Laughter ]
Trump would've been furious
but he didn't read the article.
[ Laughter and applause ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Some more news.
At a rally last night,
Trump had some trouble saying
the name of a woman he endorsed,
Leah Vukmir.
Listen to how he said it.
-So if you want to uphold
our laws, our borders,
and our way of life,
you need to vote

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:for Scott Walker
and Leah Vyukmaarr.
[ Laughter ]
-Wow.
-"And Leah Vyukmarayar."
He bails --
He bails on Walker, though.
You could hear him.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:If you play it again,
he bails on Walker.
-...for Scott Walker
and Leah Vyukmaarr.
[ Laughter ]
-He saw that name,
and he's like, "Whoa."
It sounds like he's trying
to read the Ikea catalog.
Like, "The vyukmaarr
has lots of drawers and storage

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:in the vyukmaarr."
Speaking of mispronouncing,
on a show last week,
Lou Dobbs was talking about
the migrant caravan
making its way through a town
in Mexico called Huixtla.
Check out how he said it.
-The caravan of mostly
Central American immigrants

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:is now in the Mexican city
of Wah-ho-lah tonight --
[ Laughter ]
-What?
What?!
That's --
That's -- Oh, no.
-Come on.
Wackalacka.
-I gotta see that one more time.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-...Mexican city
of Wah-ho-lah...
[ Laughter ]
-Wow. Did he just
stub his toe or something?
Hoo, haah!
-Jerry Lewis?
-Sounds like he just stepped in
a shower that's way too cold.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:He's like,
"In the town of Wa-haaaah."
[ Laughter ]
Guys, get this --
tomorrow at the White House,
Trump is hosting a summit for
young Republican black leaders.
The guest list includes Kanye.
[ Laughter ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Moving on, as I mentioned,
Trump's been...
[ Laughter ]
...speaking at a lot of rallies
and giving a lot of interviews,
and he's usually saying some
pretty questionable things.
And while
we can't filter what he says,
we can filter
how he looks when he says it.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:I'll show you what I mean.
It's time for "Trump Filters."
Here we go.
[ Cheers and applause ]
-I don't trust everybody
in the White House.
I'll be honest with you.
I'm usually guarded.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Laughter ]
And I think I'm guarded anyway,
but I'm not saying I trust
everybody in the White House.
I'm not a baby.
This is a vicious place.
[ Baby voice ] Washington, D.C.,
is a vicious, vicious place.
-Yeah, that's right.
[ Cheers and applause ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Hey, guys, Halloween
is less than a week away,
which means lots of people
will be dressing up.
But if you work in an office,
it could be a little tough
to figure out exactly what is
and is not appropriate to wear.
So, here with some last-minute
suggestions of what's acceptable
for a workplace environment

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:is Halloween costumes expert
Andrew Karn.
Welcome back, Andrew.
[ Cheers and applause ]
Everything going great?
-Yeah, very good.
Yes, very nice.
-Is it good?
The wife is good?
-Yes, wife is okay.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Wife is not doing well.
-Thank you so much
for being here.
She's not doing well?
-No, you know, it's okay.
-Oh, wow.
Sorry for that.
-Oh, no, that's all right.
-All right, well,
thank you for being here.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Andrew, you are
a Halloween costumes expert.
Is that correct?
-Yes, that's my profession.
-Oh, wow.
[ Laughter ]
Would you mind explaining
what is and is not appropriate
for a work setting?
-Absolutely.
[ Laughter ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Now, the key to choosing
an office-friendly costume
is playful caution.
For example, one costume
that is appropriate is this.
So, here we see
a classic cowboy.
-Sure, sure.
[ Laughter ]
-You know, button-down shirt
with suede vest panels.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-That's great.
-Right, perfectly work-friendly.
But what
would not be appropriate
would be something like this.
-Oh, oh, yeah.
I see.
-Now this
is a sexy baby costume.
[ Laughter ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Not sure I'd call it sexy.
-While the Teddy-bear-pattern
shirt, bib, and bonnet
are acceptable...
[ Laughter ]
...the short, bulky diaper
is far too revealing.
You can expect anyone
wearing this costume
to get a stern finger-wagging
from the boss.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Someone's been a bad baby.
-Oh, boy.
Now, see, I see --
So you're saying the cowboy
is fine but the baby is not?
-Exactly.
[ Laughter ]
It's a bit confusing.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Would you like me
to explain further?
-Yeah, please.
That would help.
-Terrific.
Now, if you want to wear
a costume that won't get you in
trouble, you can wear this.
Now pictured here...
-Oh, that's -- yeah.
-Pictured here
is your basic witch.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Understood, Andrew.
-But what absolutely
cannot be worn is this.
Now --
[ Laughter and applause ]
-Whoa, hey, that is --
Come on.
-Well, now --
-Come on.
-Wearing this costume to work

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:would get you fired
almost immediately.
-Yes, it should.
-Now, while at first
it appears to be
a standard police officer's
uniform...
[ Laughter ]
-It does?
-Yeah.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-I don't think so.
-Now, if you look closely,
you'll see a tight,
black mesh harness.
-I understand what it is.
Yeah.
-The word "police" on it.
Sexy leather hat.
Once again, reminding you
this is the police.
-Yeah, it is the police.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Sexually suggestive
dangling handcuffs.
-Yeah, okay, very good.
-And black underpants
that are mesh on the backside.
-Oh! Hey!
[ Audience screams ]
-No! That's --
No, we understand now, please.
-Do we want
to go back to the photo?

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-No, no.
-Now, aside from being
wildly inappropriate,
it's not even realistic.
I mean, I'm almost certain
I've never seen
a certified police officer
wear this outfit.
-Now, Andrew, I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,
but I'm gonna
read it off the card.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Yeah.
-I'm not --
I'm still not fully getting it.
-Well, that's perf--
[ Laughter ]
That's perfectly understandable.
-Is that right?
-Yeah, that's fine.
Yeah, that's understandable.
-What's the next --
What's the next line?

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Laughter ]
What's the next line?
-It's that someti--
I think it's that sometimes
it's confusing for people.
[ Laughter ]
-Yeah, that's true.
-Did I get it? All right!

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Yeah, you got it.
All right, yeah.
[ Cheers and applause ]
So, to clarify --
-To clarify...
-This costume --
-...is office-appropriate.
-That is appropriate?
-Very appropriate.
Now here we see a goof clown.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Laughter ]
-A goof clown?
-Yep.
Curly, multicolored rainbow wig.
Red sneaker
with exaggerated toe.
Of course, topped off
with a bulbous red nose.
-Full makeup.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Completely acceptable
and very funny.
Less acceptable, however,
is this kitty cat.
-No, no, no.
[ Laughter ]
-Or this --
Or this skeleton.
-Oh, my God.
-Or this, which I don't
even think
is a Halloween costume.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Oh, what is going on here?
[ Laughter ]
Andrew.
-You mustn't forget about these.
-Oh, now Andrew Karn!
Get out!
Andrew, get out!
No, that way!
Get out!
That way. Sorry.
That way, yeah.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Get out.
Get your stuff.
No, don't slip.
Take your stuff. It's here.
Take this with you.
Sorry.
[ Cheers and applause ]
Unbelievable.
-Unbelievable.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Unbelievable, that guy.
-Well, I never.
-Finally, the news
is so crazy lately,
sometimes it almost feels like
someone blended
a bunch of stories together.
So we thought, what if we took
some real headlines
and blended them together?

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Would the new stories be any
crazier than the actual news?
Let's find out.
If you blend the stories,
"Fashion line
releases toasty nose warmers,"
"Inflatable colon
falls off truck,"
and "Old Navy selling
trendy fleece jeans,"
you get, "Trendy fall fashion --

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Old Navy's toasty fleece
colon warmers."
[ Laughter and applause ]
Not bad.
Next up,
if you blend the stories,
"Spanx expands into swimwear,"
"Album 'Baby One More Time'
turns 20,"

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:and "Ben & Jerry
give ice cream to Democrats,"
you get "Ben gives Jerry
20 Spanx,
Jerry screams
'Baby One More Time.'"
[ Cheers and applause ]
And here's the last one.
If you blend the stories,
"Trump tweets
big night in Texas,"

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:"Toilet system on recall,"
and "Man eats
400 chili dogs a year,"
you get, "Trump eats 400
recalled chili dogs,
tweets "Big night on toilet."
There you go.
We have a great show tonight.
Give it up for The Roots!

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Well, while you guys
were clapping,
the Rams punted six more times.
-Really?
-That's right.
That's right -- Last night
was Super Bowl LIII,
and 53 is also how many people
stayed awake
for the whole thing.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Laughter ]
But I want to say
congratulations
to the New England Patriots
on winning the Super Bowl.
[ Cheers and applause ]
[ Booing ]
And to the Rams, who got to see
a free Maroon 5 concert.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:That's good.
[ Cheers and applause ]
That's right --
The Rams only scored 3 points,
and they were totally shut out
in the second half.
They said it was a little tough
to concentrate
after seeing
Adam Levine's nipples.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Laughter ]
But the Rams did set
a new record for punts.
[ Light laughter ]
This is the first time I've ever
seen a punter on the sideline
breathing into an oxygen mask.
"You've got to be kidding me.
I'm going back in?"

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Applause ]
That's right -- Rams quarterback
Jared Goff just couldn't score.
Americans said, "If we wanted
to see a football player
who can't score, we'd watch
Colton on 'The Bachelor.'"
I mean, come on.
[ Cheers and applause ]
-Whoa!

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Hey, at one point in the game,
I saw Tom Brady yelled out,
"Reagan, Reagan,"
and the Patriots ran the ball
to the right.
Did you see that?
Then later, the Rams ran a play
called Trump,
and they got sacked
by Nancy Pelosi.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Really?
Wow.
[ Applause ]
-Get this -- I read that
over 10 million workers
called in sick to work today.
That doesn't include the 53 Rams
who skipped work last night.
Oh! Hey. Whoa.
-Come on.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Come on.
-Mr. Sports, huh?
You're being a little hard
on them.
What do I care?
[ Laughter ]
I don't care. Come on.
I don't care about this.
They did a good job, I thought.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Yeah, come on.
They played a game.
-Ryan Gosling was fantastic.
-Ryan Gosling was great.
-I didn't even know
he was a quarterback.
-Really? Wow!
-Yeah.
-So exciting.
-Well, late last night,
a reporter in Boston

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:was covering
the postgame celebrations,
and she said things
were starting
to quiet down in Boston.
Watch this.
-He said things were
maybe calming down a bit.
People were starting to disperse
a little bit

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:while they are coming west.
-Six rings, baby.
-There we go.
-Six [bleep] rings!
-Okay. All right.
All right.
[ Laughter ]
-Gosh, I love Boston so much.
That was actually
the mayor of Boston.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Are you serious?
-Yeah, I've seen him before.
I've seen him on the news.
-Wow.
-"Six rings, baby."
Oh, my goodness.
At the end of the night,
Gronk spoke about
how many Super Bowl rings
he's won in his career.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:And he had a very interesting
way of breaking it down.
Watch this.
-So my friends and I,
we were chilling,
and I only played
half the season
the year we got number two.
So we were hanging out,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:and we all decided I have
one and a half rings,
'cause I only played
half that season.
That one -- The time we won it
the second time.
And they said that rounds down
for some reason to one.
And they said
if I get two rings,
that means I get another ring.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:I'll have two and a half, and
that rounds up to three, baby.
-There you go.
-I got three rings now, baby.
-There you go.
-Whoo!
[ Laughter ]
-The Rams were like,
"I can't believe we got
outsmarted by that guy."

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:What?
What the hell
are you talking about?
What?
I saw that before the game,
CBS aired an interview
with President Trump,
and he said some
pretty questionable things.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:And while we can't filter
what he says,
we can filter how he looks
when he says it.
I'll show you what I mean.
It's time for "Trump Filters."
Here we go.
[ Cheers and applause ]
-You had quite the showdown
with Speaker Pelosi.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:What did you learn about
negotiating with her?
-Well, I think that she was very
rigid, which I would expect.
She knows that
you need a barrier.
She knows that we need
border security.
And on the 15th
[High-pitched voice] we have now
set the table beautifully

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:because everybody knows
what's going on.
-But I read that during
the State of the Union,
there's always a designated
survivor who watches the speech
from a secure,
undisclosed location.
They haven't announced
who it will be this year.
But some of Trump's
cabinet members

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:have spoken up
to say it's not them.
For example, here's
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.
He said, "Not me.
I plan to sit in the front row
and slowly unwrap hard candy."
[ Laughter ]
-It's a Werther's.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-[ Imitates crinkling ]
Here's acting attorney general
Matt Whitaker.
He said, "Not me.
I've been asked to attend
so my forehead can serve
as a teleprompter."
[ Applause ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Up next is Secretary
of Agriculture Sonny Perdue.
He said, "Not me.
I'll be there
along with every member
of my all-banjo country band."
[ Applause ]
He's fantastic.
-It's all banjo.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-If you get a chance,
check them out.
-It's a banjo army.
-Next is the Director of
National Intelligence Dan Coats.
He said, "Not me.
I've haunted the House chamber
for 30 years.
My soul is forbidden
to leave the building."

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Cheers and applause ]
And finally, here's Secretary
of Education Betsy DeVos.
She said, "I'll do it.
I'll be the designated driver."
That's nice.
-That's sweet.
-Some more news.
Trump's daily schedule's
just leaked,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:and he spends more than half
of his day
on unstructured executive time.
Though to be honest,
"executive time" sounds like

"Well, executive time.
I'll see you in 20 minutes."

Executive time.
Get this -- In a recent

Today, Trump made headlines
when he called

"passive and naive."
Yeah. Passive and naive.
It sounds like a buddy-cop show
starring Mike Pence
and Donald Trump.
"I'm Passive." "I'm Naive."
-"Wall."

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-But Trump's preparing for his
State of the Union address,
which is now scheduled
for next Tuesday,
just two days
after the Super Bowl.
That's two huge events
back-to-back,
so we thought it'd be helpful to
break both of them down for you.
For example,
during the Super Bowl,

name:Jimmy Fallon

for unexpected plays.
During the State of the Union,
people will be watching Trump
pronounce words
in unexpected ways.
[ Cheers and applause ]
"A polar vertex."
-"The poller vertex."

text:-"A poly vertex."
During the Super Bowl,
people at home will take shots
every time their team scores.
During the State of the Union,
people at home will take shots
and just keep taking shots.

text:And finally,
during the Super Bowl,
fans will hold up
giant foam fingers.
During the State of the Union,
Nancy Pelosi will hold up
a different finger.
There's some major

-Wow.

the Super Bowl is this Sunday.
And on game day,

"Oh, please. We've been
doing that for years."

give a shout-out to our show's

As you may have heard

So Melania, if you're watching,
I don't think your anti-bullying
campaign is working.
[ Laughter and applause ]
It's not working.
When I saw that Trump insulted
me on Twitter, I was going to

but I thought I had
more important things to do.
Then I thought, wait, shouldn't
 he have more important things
to do?
He's the President of the --
What are you doing?
You're the President!

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Why's he tweeting at me?
But this is real -- it's a real
tweet from the President.
He wrote, "@Jimmyfallon

that he did the
famous hair show with me,
where he seriously
messed up my hair."
And that "He would have done it
differently because it is said

He is taking heat.
He called and said,
'monster ratings.'
Be a man, Jimmy!"
[ Laughter ]
It's real.
It's crazy, the President went
after me on Twitter.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:It's pretty much the only thing
I have in common with
NFL players.
I mean, it's the only thing.
I have nothing else.
[ Cheers and applause ]
Well, in response,
I made a donation
in Trump's name to the Refugee

The Refugee and Immigrant Center

Legal Services, or "RAICES."

was kicked out of
a restaurant in Virginia.
Turns out her server asked her
what she wanted as an appetizer
and out of habit,
she refused to answer.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:And --
[ Laughter and applause ]
Actually, the President
responded on Twitter
to the restaurant, which is
called The Red Hen.
Again, this is real.
Trump tweeted,
"The Red Hen Restaurant
should focus more on cleaning

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:its filthy canopies, doors,
and windows (badly needs
a paint job) rather than
refusing to serve a fine person
like Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
I always had a rule,
if a restaurant is dirty
on the outside,
it is dirty on the inside!"
So if you ever read
a Yelp review and thought,

to write this?"
the answer is, the President
of the United States.
[ Cheers and applause ]
He's writing Yelp reviews!

he had to use a teleprompter --
-Hey, Jimmy.
Sorry to interrupt.
But I actually missed
Trump's speech last night.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:I had a thing.
-You had a thing?
-That's what I said.
Anyway, considering
all of Trump's anger
about not getting the money
for his little border wall,
it must have been insane.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:So, how crazy was his speech?
-Well, as I was about to say,
because he used a teleprompter,
it was actually
pretty restrained.
-Wait, wait. Restrained?
-Low key.
-Calm?
-Tame.
-Passive?

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Controlled.
-Tempered?
-Toned down.
-Ho-hum?
-Hum-drum.
-Mild?
-Muted.
-Subdued?
-Sober.
-[ High-pitched] Mellow?!

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[Laughter]
-Mellow yellow.
-[ Normal voice ]
That's weird.
-I know.
-Anyways...
-That's that.
[ Light laughter ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Haircut?
-Last week.
-Barber shop?
-Super Cuts.
-Looks good.
-Feels short.
-Weekend plans?
-Nothing yet.
-Wanna hang?
-Guess so.
-Any thoughts?
-Man date.

-Delish.
-Breadsticks?!
-Num, num, num, num, num.
-Can't wait!
-It's on me.
-'Cause when we're there...
-We're family.
[ Cheers and applause ]
Well...

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Well, after the speech,
I saw that Sean Spicer went
on a TV show
that was broadcasting live
from the bar
at Trump's D.C. hotel.
Did you see this?
It seems like Spicer
may have had a few drinks
before he went on camera.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Watch this.
-Before I ever was there --
Hold on. Just stop.
Like, listen to me.
-Where were -- You were in a --
-[ Slurring ] I was --
I-I had a client meeting.
And I was yelling at you,
and you barely recognized me.
-[ Laughs ]
[ Laughter ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-My God.
-When the anchor said,
"Yeah, you should call
an Uber driver,"
Spicer was like,
"I am an Uber driver."
[ Laughter and applause ]
"That's what I do now."
And I --
-[ Laughs ]
"You were yelling at me."

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-"Am I a good looking guy,
you think?"
And finally, I read that
Trump's childhood home in Queens
is going up for sale.
Just to mess with him,
Nancy Pelosi's gonna buy it
and turn it into
a Mexican restaurant.
We have a great show tonight.
Give it up for The Roots!

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Well, you guys, a polar vortex
is bringing record-breaking
cold weather from up north
to large parts of the U.S.,
which explains why today
President Trump announced
that he wants to build
a border wall across Canada.
I think it's a good idea.
-Why not, right?
-But it's freezing.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:In Chicago, I heard that it's
actually colder than Antarctica.
On the news, the weatherman
wasn't giving the forecast.
He was just spooning
the camera guy for warmth.
He was like...
"Hey! Cut away! Cut away!"
I read that
by the end of the week,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:250 million Americans
will experience
freezing temperatures.
So if you can,
please check in on the elderly.
For real.
[ Laughter ]
All day long, the Patriots
kept checking on Tom Brady,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:which is --
I think that's nice.
That's very thoughtful.
-Aww.
-This morning
on the "Today" show --
You know I watch the "Today"
show every morning.
-24/7.
-Dylan Dreyer was in Minnesota

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:to cover the freezing
temperatures.
Now, some of this weather
can sound kind of scary,
but thankfully she knew
how to calm everybody down.
-Another thing you might hear
is that your eyeballs
can freeze when it's
40 to 50 below wind chills.
And you know what?
That's actually true.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Laughter ]
-Why would you tell me that?!
I'm eating Cinnamon Toast Crunch
in my pajamas.
My eyeballs can freeze?!
-Gosh.
-She's like, "Yeah, it's true.
Yes, you can.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Anyway, back to you, Hoda.
Have fun.
Have a great day today." Yeah.
I heard experts say
that during a polar vortex,
you shouldn't leave items
like beer, eggs, and medicine
in your car,
though if that's what
you're keeping in your car,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:the polar vortex is the least
of your problems.
Beer, eggs, and medicine?
"Let's leave the eggs --
Leave the eggs in there.
I don't want anyone at the party
taking them eggs."
-"Hey, you got eggs?"
-"Yeah.
I got eggs. I got beer.
My medicine."

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-"What about medicine?
You got any medicine?"
-"What do you need?
I got a couple..."
-"I need beer, eggs,
and medicine, man.
That's what I call a party.
Don't leave 'em in your car!
My eyeballs froze!"
-That's not...

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:And this morning,
President Trump
tried to talk about
global warming in a tweet.
But he spelled it wrong.
Take a look.
He wrote "global waming."
[ Laughter ]
He was like,
"Global warming is a hoax.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:But global waming is very real."
[ Cheers and applause ]
Then he said,
"I recommend staying indoors
and drinking a wam cup of tea."
-Oh.
-Here's some good news, though.
Federal employees returned
to work this week. Yes.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Cheers and applause ]
Though one woman says that
when she got back to her office
she had over 4,000
unread e-mails.
Even worse, they were all from
one employee who kept writing,
"Where is everybody?"
"Have you read the papers?"

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Some more news.
Trump's acting attorney general
says that Robert Mueller's
investigation
is close to being finished.
It's been almost two years.
Even Colton from
"The Bachelor" was like,
"I don't know how much longer
I can wait.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Come on. Let's go.
I'm ready. I'm ready."
That's right.
Trump's acting attorney general,
Matt Whitaker, talked
to reporters yesterday
about the Mueller investigation.
But while he talked, he looked
pretty uncomfortable and sweaty.
Watch this. Look at this.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-I hope that we can get
the report from Director Mueller
as soon as possible.
-Yeah.
[ Laughter ]
Could we see him again?
He looks like --

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:He looks like Lex Luthor
after a spin class.
I mean, it was...
[ Laughter ]
I mean, it's --
It's nice to see that the
Instagram egg got a job.
That's all I'm saying.
I'm just happy.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Laughter ]
And did you see this?
Yesterday, Trump's national
security adviser, John Bolton,
appeared in front of reporters
while holding a notepad,
and everybody could see
his top-secret notes.
This is real.
Take a look at this.
It says "5,000 troops
to Colombia."

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Well, it's not the first time
a politician has mistakenly
revealed what's on their notepad
during a meeting.
For example, it also happened
to Chris Christie.
His notepad said, "5,000 wings
to Super Bowl party."
[ Laughter ]
It happens a lot.
-Yeah. 5,000?

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Up next, Betsy DeVos.
Her notepad said, "5,000 minus
3,000 equals turtle."
[ Applause ]
Finally, here's
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.
His notepad said, "5,000 years
ago today, I was born."
-Okay. That makes sense.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-You got to be careful
with those notepads.
Hey, guys. The 2020 presidential
election is heating up.
And former Starbucks CEO
Howard Schultz
might run as an independent.
Now some Democrats
are threatening
to boycott Starbucks.
-Really?

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Yeah. Then Starbucks said,
"Oh, go ahead.
The food in the display case
will still be here
when you get back,
so don't worry.
It just stays like that.
Want a cake pop?
Cake pop? Cake pop?"
I don't what that is. Sorry.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:"We have different flavors
of cake pops."
Yeah, I don't know
what the cake pop is.
But it's true. Democrats
might boycott Starbucks.
You can tell 7-Eleven
is excited
'cause they just replaced
the coffee pot
that's been on the burner
all week.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Laughter ]
"I'm gonna do it."
It's now like a solid.
It's not even a liquid anymore.
It's like a syrup.
You guys hear about this?
Chris Christie's new
tell-all book came out today,
and it has some pretty shocking
revelations about Trump.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Ooh.
-You're not gonna believe this.
It turns out Trump has no idea
what he's doing.
[ Laughter ]
"What's that?"
Yep, Christie's book, "Let Me
Finish," is now available.
And Christie's trying
something different.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Instead of hard cover
or paperback,
he's offering it in hard shell
or soft tortilla.
-Oh! That's nice!
-Very sweet.
-Something different.
-Very sweet.
-Something different.
Hey, guys, last night
was an all-new episode
of "The Bachelor."

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:And while Colton was on a date
with a girl named Cassie,
they went to a fortune teller.
Listen to what they found out.
-You are the child
of the winter.
-Yeah.
-She is the spring and summer.
It means she's
your past-life sister.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Laughter ]
-That shouldn't be
on "The Bachelor."
That should be on "Maury."
You know what I'm saying?
That's the type of...
Actually, here's how Colton felt
in that moment.
He felt like this.
Yeah, exactly.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:"Wha-wha-wha-wha?"
Well, it was just
a fortune teller on the street,
so who even knows
if that matters.
Let's see how Colton and Cassie
were doing later on.
♪♪
-That's not a kiss
that a sister would give.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Laughter ]
-Hey! Yow! Ugh! Yikes.
-Colton was like, "This is
gonna be such a funny story
to tell our son/nephew someday."

Finally, this is interesting.

text:Denmark is building
a 43-mile-long fence

-Guys, I'm excited about this.
Shaquille O'Neal
is my guest tonight.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Wow!
[ Cheers and applause ]
-I'm looking forward
to seeing him.
He hasn't been here since
he put the star
on top of the Rockefeller Center
Christmas tree.
I love Shaq, but it's tough
getting him up here.
You have to maneuver him
in the elevator

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:like you're moving a couch.
It's tricky.
That's right. Shaq is here.
Or, as one guy
watching at home put it,
"Now, he would make a
great border wall.
How many Shaqs --

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Arm in arm,
how many Shaqs can we do?
Red rover, red rover."
No.
Well, good news, everybody.
Today, for the first time since
the government shutdown,
federal employees went
back to work.
[ Cheers and applause ]

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:TSA agents were so happy,
they popped open the champagne
they've been confiscating for
a special occasion.
That's how happy --
It was very nice.
Of course, the shutdown
ended on Friday,
when Trump made an announcement
that he's reopening
the government

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:after he and Democrats
reached a budget deal.
-Hey, Jimmy, sorry to interrupt.
I missed the news this weekend,
so I didn't get to hear
how much money Trump spent to
actually build that border wall.
But if he agreed
to reopen the government,
then that must mean they
gave him a lot.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:So how much did he get?
-Uh, nothing.
-Wait. Nothing?
-Nada.
-Zip?
-Zilch.
-Nothin'?
-Nil.
-Love?
-Bubkes.
-Diddly?

I saw that Trump announced
the government
was reopening in a speech,
but when he tried to talk about
the number of people
that immigration officers
had arrested,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:he had some trouble
with the word "suspected."
Listen to this.
-Last year alone,
ICE officers removed
10,000 known
or suspest...gang members.
-He got hit with, like, a
tranquilizer dart or something.
He got hit with...

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:"Uh, suspe..."
-Suspested.
-The DayQuil
just kicked in, yeah.
Of course, Trump gave that
speech using a teleprompter.
And I think his staff
finally figured out
a way to get him
to stick to the script.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Take a look at what they were
showing him on the prompter.
-I want to thank all of
the incredible federal workers.
You are fantastic people.
You are incredible patriots.
I am asking Senate Majority
Leader Mitch McConnell
to put this proposal on
the floor immediately.
We want to thank border patrol,
ICE, and all law enforcement.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Been incredible.
-That's how they get him to
stick to -- Yeah.
Here's another big story.
Trump's long-time adviser,
Roger Stone,
was arrested for
lying to Congress
in the Russia investigation.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Yeah, he's an interesting guy.
I heard Stone actually has
a tattoo
on his back of Richard Nixon.
And this is real. Look at this.
Wow.
If you think that's bad, check
out the tattoo Trump just got.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:He has Putin.
-Wow!
-Do you know that?
-Really?
-Yeah.
Well, I saw that Stone
did an interview
on CNN the other night.
And while Chris Cuomo
introduced him,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:it really looked like
Stone was blinking a lot.
And to help you keep track,
we added a ding to each blink.
Watch this.
-That link is Roger Stone,
a man Trump has known
longer and better than anyone
involved in his campaign.
Robert Mueller believes
he has tied him

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:to those DNC e-mails
stolen by the Russians
and dumped by WikiLeaks.
And they do seem,
in this indictment,
to have a ton of evidence
that there may have...
-Wow. That's Morse code
for "pardon me."
Some more news.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:I heard that former
Starbucks C.E.O. Howard Schultz
is thinking about
running for president.
Meanwhile, the C.E.O. of
Dunkin' Donuts is thinking about
running a meth lab
out of every store.
-Oh, really.
-And did you hear about this?

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Last night, there was supposed
to be a live broadcast
of the musical "Rent,"
but one of the actors
broke his foot,
so they had to air
a pre-taped rehearsal.
Actor's fine, but doctors say
he's got to wear a cast
for about 525,600 minutes.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:And, finally,
here's a local story.
New York City Police are warning

you will not find a copy

You're welcome. You're welcome.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:That's a treat.
That's a gift from me to you.
That's right. Omarosa's new
book, "Unhinged," is out.
And it's already
an Amazon best seller.
But that's just because
Trump frantically bought up
all the copies
so no one could read it.
He's like, "Hurry up. Quick.
Get Bezos on the phone."

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:Actually, Robin Roberts
from "Good Morning America"
sort of predicted
this whole thing.
Check out what she had to say
about Omarosa last year
right after she was fired
from the White House.
-She said she has
a story to tell,
and I'm sure she'll be
selling that story.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-We will see.
-Yeah, she will. Bye, Felicia.
[ Laughter ]
Whoa! Ow!
Wow!
-[ Laughs ]
I remember that, yeah.
Then Trump was like,
"Wait. Who's Felicia?

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:I thought her name was Omarosa.
Can we hire Felicia?
Is she available?"
But I saw that Omarosa said
that she was interviewed
by the head of the Russia
investigation, Robert Mueller.
Before they started,
Mueller said,
"This interview
is being recorded,"

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:and Omarosa was like, "Yeah, I
know. I'm the one recording it.
[ Laughter ]
I should be telling you that."
And on "Fox & Friends"
this morning,
Brian Kilmeade said that
Omarosa had outsmarted Trump.
Though, to be fair,
Trump's also been outsmarted

text:by the child safety locks
in his limo.
He's like,
"Ohh. Can you unlock me?"

-What, how are you doing? Well?
-Yes, very good. How are you?
-I'm doing great.
Everything's good?
-Things are bad.

-No things are --
-The kids are good?

all of it is bad.

-Yes, nice to see you

-Welcome back.
-Yeah.
-As I said.
Andrew,
as an independent expert,
can you give us some tips
on what to wear
to an office holiday party?
-I'd love nothing more.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:[ Laughter ]
Now, in planning for
an office holiday party,
it's important to look stylish
yet joyful.
-Okay.
-This outfit, for instance --
[ Laughter ] -

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-Oh, that's you there.
-Yeah.
-That's a picture of you.
-Now this is both mindful
of an office dress code
as well as evocative
of the holiday spirit,
which is reflected in
the crimson-colored
argyle sweater,
and Santa Claus head hat.
-The head hat.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-The head hat, yes.
-Now what should someone
not wear to
an office holiday party?
-Something like this.
[ Laughter ]
Now.
-Oh, no, man. Come on. Andrew.
-Now, while the red coloring
does conjure up

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:the Christmas spirit --
-Okay.
-The nipple-colored jacket,
and groin garnish --
-Yeah, groin garnish, yeah.
-Sorry, nipple crops,
I meant to say.
Now, this person really looks
like garbage.
Sometimes it's better
to let a Christmas present

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:remain unwrapped.
-That's good.
Now, Andrew,
so you're saying that
the first outfit is good,
but the second one is bad.
-Yes, it's slightly difficult.
It's confusing.
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah.
Perhaps I should give
another example.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-That's a great idea.
-Now, if you're looking for
an appropriate party outfit,
this one's a winner.
-Okay, okay.
-Approachable.
-That's the picture you want
to go with there Andrew?
Is that you --
-The outfit is a winner.
-Yep.

-Uh-huh.
-Inoffensive.
-Uh-huh.
That's right.
-Snazzy necktie with frostman
the snowman on it.

-Frostman the snowman. Yep.
Frosty the snowman.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-I believe --
I think it's frostman.
[ Laughter ]
-Okay.
-This outfit --
-Yeah, it's very nice.
-Conveys Christmas warmth,
as well as a respect
for the institutions
of the modern American office.

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:-All right good.
-Yeah.
-That's very, very good.
-But what does not convey
respect is this.
[ Laughter ]
-No, no, no, no, no.
That's too much now.
You've gone too far.
-Now, while the

mind Christmas decorations
of yore.
-Yeah, no yeah.
-The salmon-colored
one-piece brings to mind
a bloated male member
of the Rockettes.

-Wearing something like this
would put you on both Santa's,
and HR's naughty list.

text:Does that all make sense?
-I'm afraid not.
I'm still actually confused.
-Oh, understandable.
-Yeah.
[ Laughter ]
-Now to clarify,
this is an excellent outfit
to wear to an office party.
-Yeah, okay.

text:These are more examples.
-This, however, is not.
-Okay.
-Yeah.
-All right, well that's --
-It's kind of a Hanukkah theme.
-That's it. I think I'm getting
it, but I'm not quite there yet.
-Fine.
This is not acceptable,

name:Jimmy Fallon

text:while this
is even less acceptable.
-Okay, I understand --
I see what you're saying.
-Yeah.
-So, you're saying that
this is something
you should not wear.
-Correct.
-And this is also something
you should not wear.
-Yes. Yes. Correct.

Welcome, and most importantly, congratulations!
Congratulations to everyone who's nominated tonight.
Thank you for letting me be a part of this.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:I'm excited. I've never been to the Oscars before.
This is my first time here
and the way you people go through hosts, it's probably my last time here, so I'm gonna enjoy this while I'm here.
This broadcast is being watched live by millions of Americans
and around the world in more than 225 countries that now hate us.
And I think that is an amazing thing.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:As you know, I don't have to tell anybody, the country is divided right now.
I've been getting a lot of advice
people have been telling me it's time to bring everyone together
you need to say something to unite us, and
let's just get something straight off the top
I'm not-- I can't do that. That's not-- there's only one Braveheart

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:in this room, and he's not gonna unite us either.  Okay?
Mel, you look great. I think the Scientology is working, I really do.
I'm not the man to unite this country, but it can be done.
You know, if every person watching this show
I don't want to get too serious, but there are millions and millions of people watching right now
and if every one of you took a minute to reach out to one person

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:you disagree with - someone you like - and have a positive
considerate conversation - not as liberals or conservatives
as Americans, if we would all do that, we could make America great again. We really could.
It starts with us.
And tonight, in the spirit of healing and bringing people together, I would like to bury the hatchet
with someone I've had issues with.  I would.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:Matt Damon. Now Matt, I've known Matt for a long time now.
You know, I've known Matt so long, when I first met Matt, I was the fat one.
Okay?  True.
And we've had problems. He's a selfish person.
Those of you who have worked with him know this.
But Matt did something very unselfish and I want to commend him for it.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:For real. Matt, as you probably know, could have starred
in "Manchester By The Sea", he was the producer
it's nominated for six Oscars including Lead Actor
and he could have taken that lead actor part for himself.
But he didn't, he gave that role to Casey Affleck, his childhood friend.
He handed what turned out to be an Oscar caliber role

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:over to his friend and made a Chinese ponytail movie instead.
And that movie, "The Great Wall" went on to lose 80 million dollars.
Smooth move, dumbass.
See? It's so easy to reach out and heal. And I want to say-- maybe this is not
a popular thing to say, but I want to say thank you to President Trump.
I mean remember last year when it seemed like the Oscars were racist?

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:That's gone!
Thanks to him.
What a night. It has been an amazing year for movies.
Black people saved NASA and white people saved jazz.
That's what we call progress.

we didn't see "Elle" but we absolutely loved it. You were amazing in that film
and I'm glad Homeland Security let you in tonight. I really am.
We are very welcoming to outsiders here in Hollywood.
We don't discriminate against people based on what countries they come from
we discriminate against them based on their age and weight.

Oh you can barely even see him, he got so thin
There he is. He lost 40 pounds for his role in the movie, "Silence".

Viggo Mortensen, who is terrific, is nominated for Best Actor
for his performance in the movie, "Captain Fantastic"

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:and it is so well deserved. Too often The Academy only recognizes movies that people have seen.
And I just think it's wonderful.
We are here tonight to honor great actors
but we're also here to honor the actors who seem great, but actually really aren't.
And of all the "great" actors here in Hollywood
one in particular has stood the test of time for her many uninspiring and overrated performances.

And may I say, from her mediocre early work in "The Dear Hunter" and "Out of Africa"
to her underwhelming performances in "Kramer vs. Kramer" and "Sophie's Choice",
Meryl Streep has phoned it in for more than 50 films
over the course of her lackluster career.
This is Meryl's 20th Oscar nomination.

text:Made even more amazing considering the fact that she wasn't even in a movie this year
we just wrote her name down out of habit.
Meryl, stand up if you would. Everybody please join me in giving Meryl Streep
a totally undeserved round of applause, will you?
The highly overrated Meryl Streep, everyone.
We're gonna have fun tonight. I hope we're gonna have fun tonight.

This is exciting. I think it's important that we all-- I know we've all seen it all, but it's important
that we take a second to appreciate what is happening here
we're at The Oscars, The Academy Awards. You're nominated! You got to come!
Your families are nominated, your friends-- some of you will get to come up here on this stage tonight
and give a speech that the President of the United States will tweet about

WE HAD A "BACHELOR IN PARADISE,"
KIDS GOING BACK TO SCHOOL.
WE WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT -- 
THERE'S A HORRIBLE NEW PAIR OF

I EVEN THOUGHT HEY, MAYBE WE 
WON'T TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP 
MUCH TONIGHT.
AND THEN HE OPENED HIS MOUTH AND
ALL MANNER OF STUPID CAME OUT.

text:[ LAUGHTER ]
AND I'M NOT JOKING WHEN I SAY I 
WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IF 
CERSEI LANNISTER WAS RUNNING 
THIS COUNTRY AT THIS POINT.
[ LAUGHTER ]

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:THIS PRESS CONFERENCE TODAY.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW THIS.
I KNOW A LOT OF YOU ARE HERE ON 
VACATION.
IT STARTED -- IT WAS SUPPOSED TO
BE A PRESS CONFERENCE ABOUT 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:INFRASTRUCTURE, AND IT ENDED 
WITH OUR PRESIDENT MAKING AN 
ANGRY AND PASSIONATE DEFENSE OF 
WHITE SUPREMACISTS.
IT WAS LIKE IF YOUR BOOK CLUB 
MEETING TURNED INTO A COCK 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:FIGHT.
IT REALLY WAS REMARKABLE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I DON'T KNOW WHO DECIDED IT 
WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO SEND HIM
OUT THERE TO TALK TO REPORTERS 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:TODAY.
BUT WHOEVER DID OBVIOUSLY 
MISREAD HIS STATE OF MIND AND 
THE MOOD IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT 
NOW.
I FEEL LIKE I CAN SAY THIS WITH 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:REASONABLE CERTAINTY.
THE PRESIDENT IS COMPLETELY 
UNHINGED.
THE WHEELS ARE OFF THE WAGON AND
HURTLING TOWARD THE MOON RIGHT 
NOW.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:[ LAUGHTER ]
I HAVE SOME CLIPS TO SHOW YOU.
AND BEFORE I DO I WANT TO SAY 
CLIPS ARE ONE THING.
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE EDITED DOWN.
WE CHOOSE THEM FOR CONTENT.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:BUT IF YOU GET A CHANCE GO 
ONLINE AND WATCH THE WHOLE PRESS
CONFERENCE FROM BEGINNING TO 
END.
IT'S ASTONISHING.
THE ONLY THING I CAN COMPARE IT 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:TO IS REMEMBER WHEN MIKE TYSON 
BIT EVANDER HOLYFIELD'S EAR OFF?
AND THEN HE BIT HIS OTHER EAR 
OFF?
[ LAUGHTER ]
THIS WAS THE PRESIDENTIAL 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:EQUIVALENT OF THAT.
TRUMP WASN'T EVEN SCHEDULED TO 
TAKE QUESTIONS TODAY.
HE WAS GOING TO GIVE A BRIEF 
UPDATE ON AN EXECUTIVE ORDER HE 
SIGNED TO BOOST INFRASTRUCTURE.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:BUT REPORTERS WANTED TO ASK 
ABOUT HIS WEAK RESPONSE TO WHAT 
HAPPENED IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, AND
THINGS WENT INFRASTRUCING NUTS 
FROM THERE.
>> HONESTLY IF THE PRESS WAS NOT

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:FAKE AND WAS HONEST THE PRESS 
WOULD HAVE SAID WHAT I SAID WAS 
VERY NICE.
BUT UNLIKE YOU AND -- EXCUSE ME.
UNLIKE YOU AND UNLIKE THE MEDIA,
BEFORE I MAKE A STATEMENT I LIKE

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:TO KNOW THE FACTS.
>> Jimmy: THAT'S RIGHT.
HE'S VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]
LIKE THE FACT THAT TED CRUZ'S 
FATHER KILLED JFK AND OBAMA WAS 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:BORN IN KENYA.
HE'S A STICKLER FOR THE FACTS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO WHEN THEY GOT TO HIS 
STATEMENT ABOUT PUTTING THE 
BLAME FOR THE MURDER AND THE 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:HATE CRIMES IN CHARLOTTESVILLE 
ON MANY SIDES, NOT JUST THE 
NAZIS AND KLAN MEMBERS, A 
STATEMENT HE TRIED TO SOFTEN 
YESTERDAY BY SPECIFICALLY 
DENOUNCING THOSE GROUPS, NOT 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:ONLY DID HE GO BACK TO HIS 
ORIGINAL STATEMENT.
HE DOUBLED DOWN AND ACTUALLY 
DEFENDED THEIR ACTIONS.
>> WHEN YOU SAY THE ALT-RIGHT, 
DEFINE ALT-RIGHT TO ME.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:YOU DEFINE IT.
GO AHEAD.
>> I'M SAYING -- 
>> NO, DEFINE IT FOR ME.
>> SENATOR McCAIN DEFINED THEM 
AS THE SAME GROUP -- 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:>> OKAY, WHAT ABOUT THE ALT-LEFT
THAT CAME CHARGING -- EXCUSE ME.
WHAT ABOUT THE ALT-LEFT THAT 
CAME CHARGING AT AS YOU SAY THE 
ALT-RIGHT?
DO THEY HAVE ANY SEMBLANCE OF 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:GUILT?
LET ME ASK YOU THIS.
WHAT ABOUT THE FACT THEY CAME 
CHARGING, THAT THEY CAME 
CHARGING WITH CLUBS IN THEIR 
HANDS, SWINGING CLUBS?

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:DO THEY HAVE ANY PROBLEM?
I THINK THEY DO.
>> Jimmy: I THINK WE DO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I THINK IS -- I THINK WE MIGHT 
NEED AN ALT-PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:>> I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING.
I WATCHED THIS VERY CLOSELY, 
MUCH MORE CLOSELY THAN YOU 
PEOPLE WATCHED IT.
AND YOU HAVE -- YOU HAD A GROUP 
ON ONE SIDE THAT WAS BAD AND YOU

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:HAD A GROUP ON THE OTHER SIDE 
THAT WAS ALSO VERY VIOLENT.
AND NOBODY WANTS TO SAY THAT.
BUT I'LL SAY IT RIGHT NOW.
>> Jimmy: DON'T SAY IT RIGHT 
NOW.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:[ LAUGHTER ]
DON'T EVER.
SO HE PUT BLAME ON BOTH SIDES.
BUT HE ALSO HAD KIND WORDS FOR 
BOTH SIDES.
>> NEO-NAZIS STARTED THIS.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:THEY CAME TO CHARLOTTESVILLE, 
THEY SHOWED UP IN 
CHARLOTTESVILLE -- 
>> EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME.
THEY DIDN'T -- YOU HAD SOME VERY

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:BAD PEOPLE IN THAT GROUP.
BUT YOU ALSO HAD PEOPLE THAT 
WERE VERY FINE PEOPLE.
ON BOTH SIDES.
>> Jimmy: VERY FINE PEOPLE ON 
BOTH SIDES.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF THE VERY 
FINE PEOPLE ON THE TRUMP SIDE 
THERE.
THIS IS FROM THE RALLY ON 
FRIDAY.
>> YOU WILL NOT REPLACE US!

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:>> Jimmy: SO HERE'S THE THING.
IF YOU'RE WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE
AND THEY'RE CHANTING THINGS LIKE
"JEWS WILL NOT REPLACE US" AND 
YOU DON'T IMMEDIATELY LEAVE THAT
GROUP, YOU ARE NOT A VERY FINE 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:PERSON.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
AND BY THE WAY, TODAY DAVID 
DEUX, WHO IS A VERY FINE FORMER 
GRAND WIZARD OF THE KKK, TWEETED
"THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:YOUR HONESTY AND COURAGE TO TELL
THE TRUTH ABOUT 
CHARLOTTESVILLE."
WHEN DAVID DUKE THANKS YOU FOR 
YOUR HONESTY AND COURAGE, 
SOMETHING HAS GONE AWRY.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:[ LAUGHTER ]
AND THEN AFTER ALL THIS, AFTER 
15 STRAIGHT MINUTES OF 
UNPRECEDENTED INSANITY, AND YOU 
REALLY SHOULD WATCH THE WHOLE 
THING, OUR PRESIDENT, AS HE LEFT

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:THE PODIUM, SAID THIS.
>> THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
>> DO YOU PLAN TO GO TO 
CHARLOTTESVILLE, MR. PRESIDENT?

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:>> GOOD AFTERNOON AND WELCOME TO
THE LEAD.
AND -- WOW.
THAT WAS SOMETHING ELSE.
HE'S STILL TALKING.
LET'S STAY LISTENING.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

YOU'LL SEE.
>> WHERE IS --

I MEAN, I KNOW A LOT ABOUT 
CHARLOTTESVILLE.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:CHARLOTTESVILLE IS A GREAT PLACE
THAT'S BEEN VERY BADLY HURT OVER

I OWN ACTUALLY ONE OF THE LARGE 
YFT WINERIES IN THE UNITED 
STATES.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:IT'S IN CHARLOTTESVILLE.
>> Jimmy: HE CAN'T RESIST A 
PLUG.
HE JUST CAN'T.
[ LAUGHTER ]
MY WINE IS FANTASTIC.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:ESPECIALLY THE WHITE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THERE ARE SOME VERY FINE 
BOTTLES.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
THIS IS SO CRAZY.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:EVERYBODY'S BEEN ASKING, YOU 
THINK TRUMP'S GOING TO LAST FOUR
YEARS?
I'M WONDERING NOW IF ANY OF US 
ARE GOING TO LAST FOUR YEARS.
THIS IS -- I HAVEN'T SCREAMED AT

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:MY TV THIS MUCH SINCE McDREAMY 
DIED REALLY IS THE LAST TIME.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THE ONLY PERSON WHO'S HAPPY 
RIGHT NOW IS SEAN SPICER.
HE'S DOING BACKFLIPS WHEREVER 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:THE HELL HE IS.
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS.
I WANT TO SPEAK TO THOSE OF YOU 
WHO VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP.
AND FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO SAY 
I GET IT.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:I ACTUALLY DO.
YOU'RE UNHAPPY WITH THE WAY 
THINGS WERE GOING.
YOU WANTED SOMEONE TO COME IN 
AND SHAKE THINGS UP.
YOU DIDN'T WANT BUSINESS AS 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:USUAL.
NOTHING EVER SEEMS TO GET DONE.
IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME.
THESE CANDIDATES MAKE A LOT OF 
PROMISES THAT GO NOWHERE.
IT HAPPENS OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:AND YOU'RE SICK OF IT.
AND SO THIS GUY SHOWS UP RIDING 
DOWN A GOLDEN ESCALATOR.
HE'S NOT PART OF THE POLITICAL 
ESTABLISHMENT.
IN FACT, HE'S THE OPPOSITE OF 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:THAT.
HE'S A BILLIONAIRE.
MAYBE.
HE'S WRITTEN BOOKS.
HE'S NOT POLITICALLY CORRECT.
HE'S NOT EVEN CORRECT USUALLY.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:[ LAUGHTER ]
HE TALKS TOUGH.
HE WANTS TO DRAIN THE SWAMP.
SOMETIMES HE CAN BE FUNNY.
HE RIPS INTO HIS OPPONENTS IN A 
WAY POLITICIANS NEVER DO, HAVE 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:NEVER DONE BEFORE.
AND YOU THOUGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS GUY'S DIFFERENT AND THAT'S 
WHAT I WANT.
DIFFERENT.
LET'S ROLL THE DICE, LET'S GET 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:HIM IN THERE, HAVE HIM RUN THE 
COUNTRY LIKE A BUSINESS.
CUT THE DEAD WEIGHT, TOUGHEN 
EVERYONE UP.
LET'S SHAKE THIS ETCH-A-SKETCH 
HARD AND START OVER.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:SO YOU VOTE FOR HIM.
YOU PICK HIM OVER JEB BUSH AND 
TED CRUZ AND JOHN KASICH AND A 
DOZEN OTHER REPUBLICANS WHOSE 
NAMES WE FORGOT.
AND ULTIMATELY HE BEATS THEM.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:HE STROLLS IN, HE BEATS ALL OF 
THESE GUYS.
THESE GUYS WHO HAVE BEEN IN 
POLITICS FOREVER.
AND THEN HE BEATS THE ULTIMATE 
POLITICAL INSIDER, HILLARY 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:CLINTON, A WOMAN WHO'S BEEN 
RUNNING FOR OFFICE -- A WOMAN 
WHO RAN FOR PRESIDENT OF HER 
MOTHER'S UTERUS IN THE WOMB.
FOREVER.
[ LAUGHTER ]

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:HE BEATS HER.
EVERYONE SAID HE COULDN'T.
[ APPLAUSE ]
EVERYONE SAID HE WOULDN'T.
BUT HE DID.
AND IT'S EXCITING BECAUSE THIS 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:IS YOUR GUY.
YOU PICKED A HORSE LIKE 35-1 AND
SOMEHOW IT PAID OFF.
SO NOW HE'S THE PRESIDENT.
AND IT STARTS OFF OKAY.
MEETS WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA AND 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:THEY SEEM TO HAVE A NICE 
CONVERSATION.
THEN HE MOVES INTO THE WHITE 
HOUSE.
RIGHT OFF THE BAT HE'S ANGRY AT 
THE MEDIA FOR REPORTING THE 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:CROWD AT HIS INAUGURATION WAS 
SMALLER THAN HE THOUGHT IT WAS.
WHICH WAS WEIRD BUT NOT 
IMPORTANT REALLY.
AND HE CLAIMED AND STOPPED 
RAINING WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING AT 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:HIS INAUGURAL ADDRESS, WHICH 
EVERYONE COULD SEE IT WAS 
RAINING.
BUT OKAY.
IT WAS HIS FIRST WEEK.
YOU GIVE HIM A BREAK.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:SEW GETS IN THERE, HIRES HIS 
DAUGHTER.
HE HIRES HIS SON-IN-LAW.
DEMANDS AN INVESTIGATION OF 
VOTER FRAUD EVEN THOUGH HE WON 
THE ELECTION.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:[ LAUGHTER ]
HE CALLS THE PRIME MINISTER OF 
AUSTRALIA AND HANGS UP ON HIM.
HE WON'T SHAKE ANGELA MERKEL'S 
HAND.
HE DOESN'T KNOW FREDERICK 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:DOUGLASS ISN'T ALIVE.
HE CLAIMS HE CAN'T RELEASE HIS 
TAX RETURNS BECAUSE THEY'RE 
UNDER AUDIT, THEN SAYS HE'S NOT 
GOING TO RELEASE THEM AT ALL.
HE SIGNS A BAN ON MUSLIMS THAT 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:HE CLAIMS ISN'T A BAN ON 
MUSLIMS.
HE COMPLIMENTS THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE PHILIPPINES FOR MURDERING 
DRUG ADDICTS.
HOURS AFTER A TERROR ATTACK IN 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:LONDON HE STARTS A FIGHT WITH 
THEIR MAYOR.
AFTER CRITICIZING OBAMA FOR 
PLAYING GOLF HE PLAYS GOLF EVERY
WEEKEND.
HE ACCIDENTALLY SHARES 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:CLASSIFIED INTELLIGENCE WITH THE
RUSSIANS.
HE TWEETS A TYPO AT MIDNIGHT, 
THEN WAKES UP AND CLAIMS IT WAS 
A SECRET MESSAGE.
[ LAUGHTER ]

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:HE PRAISES JIM COMEY IN OCTOBER,
CALLS HIM A COWARD IN JUNE.
HE FIRES HIM.
HE LASHES OUT AT HIS OWN 
ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR RECUSING 
HIMSELF FROM AN INVESTIGATION.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:HE HIRES THE MOOCH, HE FIRES THE
MOOCH.
HE BANS THE TRANSGENDER IN THE 
MILITARY WITHOUT TELLING ANYONE 
IN THE MILITARY HE'S DOING IT.
HE PLAYS CHICKEN WITH KIM JONG 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:UN.
AND THAT'S JUST SOME OF THE 
LIST.
IF I WENT THROUGH ALL OF IT IT 
WOULD BE LONGER THAN THE MENU AT
THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:IT WOULD BE HUGE.
[ APPLAUSE ]
SO HERE HE IS BY EVERY 
REASONABLE ACCOUNT, AND I'M 
USING HIS OWN WORDS HERE, HE IS 
A TOTAL DISASTER.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:HE SCREWS UP ROYALLY EVERY DAY.
SOMETIMES TWO OR THREE TIMES A 
DAY.
WE CAN'T KEEP UP WITH IT.
THINGS COME OUT OF NOWHERE.
EVERY DAY THERE'S SOMETHING 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:NUTS.
BUT YOU'VE BEEN TRYING TO IGNORE
IT BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO 
ADMIT TO THESE SMUG ANNOYING 
LIBERALS THAT THEY WERE RIGHT.
THAT'S THE LAST THING YOU WANT 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:TO DO.
BUT THE TRUTH IS DEEP DOWN 
INSIDE YOU KNOW YOU MADE A 
MISTAKE.
YOU KNOW YOU PICKED THE WRONG 
GUY.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:AND IT ISN'T GETTING BETTER.
IT'S GETTING WORSE.
SO YOU CAN DO ONE OF TWO THINGS.
YOU CAN DIG IN LIKE CHRIS 
CHRISTIE AT A HOMETOWN BUFFET.
[ LAUGHTER ]

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:OR YOU CAN TREAT THE SITUATION 
LIKE YOU WOULD IF YOU'D PUT 
"STAR WARS" WALLPAPER UP IN THE 
KITCHEN.
ALL RIGHT, I GOT CAUGHT UP.
I WAS EXCITED.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:I MADE A MISTAKE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND NOW IT NEEDS TO GO.
WELL, NOW HE DOES NEED TO GO.
SO IT'S TIME FOR ESPECIALLY YOU 
WHO VOTED FOR HIM -- 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
-- TO TELL HIM TO GO.
PLEASE.
THINK ABOUT IT.
IT MAKES IT -- HE DOESN'T EVEN 
WANT TO BE PRESIDENT.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:HE'S MISERABLE.
BUT HE WON'T RESIGN BECAUSE HIS 
EGO IS TOO BIG.
HE CAN'T DO IT.
SO EITHER WE IMPEACH HIM, WHICH 
COULD HAPPEN BUT IT MIGHT NOT, 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:OR WE DO WHAT HE WOULD DO IN 
THIS SITUATION.
WE NEGOTIATE.
WE MAKE A DEAL.
AND I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO 
SOUND NUTS, BUT I HAVE AN IDEA.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:SO HEAR ME OUT ON THIS.
I THINK THIS COULD SOLVE ALL OUR
PROBLEMS.
WE'RE ALL GOING TO HAVE TO BE ON
BOARD WITH THIS.
INSTEAD OF PRESIDENT WE MAKE 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:DONALD TRUMP KING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OKAY?
WE MAKE HIM THE FIRST KING OF 
AMERICA.
THINK ABOUT IT.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:ENGLAND HAS A QUEEN.
SHE LIVES IN A PALACE.
EVERYONE MAKES A BIG DEAL WHEN 
SHE SHOWS UP.
SHE HAS NO POWER AT ALL.
IN THE MORNING THEY PUT A CROWN 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:ON HER HEAD, SHE STANDS THERE 
AND WAVES, SHE GOES BACK TO BED.
THAT'S.
IF THE QUEEN WERE TO WALK OUT ON
THE BALCONY AND OPEN HER SHIRT 
NOTHING OVER THERE WOULD CHANGE.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:THE QUEEN COULD BE COMPLETELY 
BONKERS, IT WOULD MAKE NO 
DIFFERENCE AT ALL.
SHE'D STILL BE QUEEN, IT WOULD 
STILL BE FINE.
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO WITH 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:DONALD TRUMP.
WE NEED TO SET HIM UP IN A 
CASTLE, MAYBE IN FLORIDA.
LEAD HIM TO THE TOP.
AND THEN LOCK THE DOOR TO THAT 
CASTLE.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
FOREVER.
EVERYONE CAN CALL HIM YOUR 
HIGHNESS.
MAYBE WE GIVE HIM A SCEPTER THAT
HE CAN HOLD.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:HE CAN SIT THERE WATCHING "FOX &
FRIENDS," MAYBE CHIP GOLF BALLS 
OUT OF THE WINDOW OF HIS TOWER.
THERE'S NO WAY HE TURNS THAT 
DEAL INTO.
IF WE TELL HIM HE'S GOING TO BE 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:THE KING.
WE'VE GOT TO GET CREATIVE HERE.
BECAUSE ENOUGH IS -- DESPERATE 
TIMES CALL FOR DESPERATE 
MEASURES.
AND I'M ASKING YOU, THE PEOPLE 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

STEP IN AND HELP FOR THE GOOD OF
THIS COUNTRY.
MIKE PENCE IS READY.
HE'S BORING.
HE'S RELATIVELY SANE.

THE PEOPLE DONALD TRUMP HASN'T 
BEEN PAYING FOR THE LAST THREE 
WEEKS.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:ONE REPORTER JON KARL ASKED WHY 
THEY DIDN'T JUST PAY THE

>> WHY NOT SIGN THE BILL SO THE 
WORKERS --

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:I DON'T WANT TO SET THE 
EXPECTATIONS TOO HIGH, BUT, WE 
ALL KNOW THE HOUSE ISN'T GOING 
TO AUTHORIZE THE MONEY TO PAY 
FOR THIS WALL.
IT'S A WASTE.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:EVEN DONALD TRUMP KNOWS IT 
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
HE PROMISED IT, BECAUSE HE 
DIDN'T THINK HE WAS GOING TO 
WIN.
HE MIGHT AS WELL PROMISE US ALL 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:JET PACKS.
HE TOLD THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR
HIM THAT HE WAS GOING TO BUILD 
IT, NOW THEY WANT IT BUILT.
HOW DOES HE GET OUT OF IT 
WITHOUT LOOKING LIKE HE LOST.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:WE PRETEND TO BUILD THE WALL.
TRUMPCARES SO 
TRUMP CARES SO LITTLE ABOUT THE 
WALL, HE MIGHT AS WELL START 
CALLING IT ERIC.
AND TELL THE RED HAT CLUB THAT 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:THE WALL IS APPROVED, IT'S GOING
UP, WE FOUND A POT OF GOLD ON 
THE TIJUANA BORDER, WE'RE USE 
BEING THAT TO BUILD IT.
THERE'S NO REASON TO BE HONEST.
IF TRUMP TELLS HIS TRUMPERS THAT

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:THE WALL IS BEING BUILT, THEY'LL
BELIEVE IT.
ARE THEY GOING TO GO DOWN THERE 
AND CHECK?
NO.
JUST TAKE A PICTURE OF HIM IN A 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:HARD HAT.
HE CAN CUT THE RIBBON, A GROUP 
OF ACTORS CAN COME IN AND START 
DIGGING.
HE'S HAPPY, WE'RE HAPPY AND 
EVERYBODY CAN GO BACK TO WORK.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:JUST MAYBE AT THE END OF ALL 
THIS DONALD TRUMP WILL REALIZE 
THAT THE WALL HE THOUGHT HE 
WE ARE BACK AT IT.
WE'VE BEEN ON SUMMER VACATION 
FOR THE LAST TWO WEEKS.

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:AND A LOT HAPPENED WHILE WE WERE
GONE.
THE LAKERS SIGNED JaVALE McGEE.
THAT WAS A BIG THING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THEY SAID IT COULD PUT THEM BACK

I MISSED A LOT OF THE NEWS 
BECAUSE I WAS IN THE WILDERNESS 
OVER THE BREAK.
I WAS IN THE BOB MARSHALL 
WILDERNESS IN MONTANA, WHICH IS

HAPPENING.

IT'S HARD BECAUSE WHEN YOU DON'T
HAVE WI-FI YOU CAN'T GOOGLE 
ANYTHING.
YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY KNOW 
THINGS.

AT SOME POINT SOMEBODY SAID WHAT
DO WE DO IF WE RUN INTO A BEAR?
SO I WENT REFLEXIVELY FOR MY 
PHONE, AND I WAS LIKE, I GUESS 
WE THROW THIS AT IT?

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:I DON'T KNOW.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ALL WE HAD, OUR ONLY 
COMMUNICATION WITH THE OUTSIDE 
WORLD WAS A SATELLITE PHONE, 
WHICH COSTS LIKE -- LIKE A KIA 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:SOUL A MINUTE TO OPERATE.
IT'S EXPENSIVE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SOUGHT PLAN WAS TO ONLY USE IT 
FOR EMERGENCIES, BUT A COUPLE 
DAYS INTO THE TRIP THE GUY WHO 

name:Jimmy Kimmel

text:HAD THE PHONE GETS A TEXT FROM 
MY WIFE, AND I WAS WORRIED, YOU 
KNOW, WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

name:Jon Steward

text:I have I have one job and it's a pretty
simple job I come in in the morning and
we look at the news and I wreck jokes
about it and then I make a couple of
faces and a like a like a noise like a
huh and uh and then it's just chi-ching

name:Jon Steward

text:and I'm out the door um but I didn't do
my job today I didn't so I apologize I
got nothing for you
in terms of like jokes and sounds
because of what happened in South
Carolina and maybe if I wasn't here in

name:Jon Steward

text:the end of the run or this wasn't such a
common occurrence maybe I could have
pulled out of the spiral but I didn't
and so I honestly have have nothing
other than just sadness once again that
we have to peer into the abyss of the

name:Jon Steward

text:depraved violence that we do to each
other and the Nexus of a just gaping
racial wound that will not heal yet we
pretend doesn't exist
and I'm confident though that by
acknowledging it by staring into that

name:Jon Steward

text:and seeing it for what it is we still
won't do jack yeah that's us and that's
the part that blows my mind I don't want
to get into the political argument of
the guns and things but what what blows
my mind is the disparity of response

name:Jon Steward

text:between when we think people that are
foreign are going to kill us and us
killing ourselves if this had been what
we thought was Islamic terrorism it
would fit into our we invaded two
countries and spent trillions of dollars

name:Jon Steward

text:and thousands of American lives and now
fly unmanned death machines over like
five or six different countries all to
keep Americans safe that's got it we got
to do whatever we can
well torture people we got to do

name:Jon Steward

text:whatever we can to keep Americans
nine people shot in a church what about
that hey what are you gonna do crazy is
as crazy is right that's the part that I
cannot for the life of me wrap my head
around and you know it you know that

name:Jon Steward

text:it's gonna go down the same path this is
a terrible tragedy they're already using
a the nuanced language of lack of effort
for this this is a terrorist attack this
is a violent attack on the Emanuel
Church in South Carolina which is a

name:Jon Steward

text:symbol for the black community it has
stood in that part of Charleston for a
hundred and some years and has been
attacked viciously many times as many
black churches have and to pretend that
I heard someone on the news say well

name:Jon Steward

text:tragedy has visited this church this
wasn't a tornado this was a racist this
was a guy with a Rhodesia badge on his
sweater and you know so the idea that
we're you know I hate to even use this
pun but this one is black and white it's

name:Jon Steward

text:there's no nuance here this is
and we're gonna keep pretending like I
don't get it what happened there's one
guy lost is mine but this we are steeped
in that culture in this country and we
refuse to recognize it and I cannot

name:Jon Steward

text:believe how hard people are working to
discount it in South Carolina the roads
that black people drive on are named for
Confederate generals who fought to keep
black people from being able to drive
freely on that road that's that's

name:Jon Steward

text:insanity
that's racial wallpaper that's that's
you can't allow that you know nine
people were shot in a black church by a
white guy who hated them who wanted to
start some kind of civil war the

name:Jon Steward

text:Confederate flag flies over South
Carolina and the roads are named for
Confederate generals and the white guy
is the one who feels like his country's
being taken away from them we're
bringing it on ourselves and that's the

name:Jon Steward

text:thing al Qaeda all those guys Isis
they're not compared to the damage that
we can apparently do ourselves on a
regular basis
so our guest tonight is an incredible
person who suffered unspeakable violence

name:Jon Steward

text:by extremists and her perseverance and
determination through that to continue
on is an incredible inspiration and to
be quite honest with you I don't think
there's anyone else in the world I would
rather talk to tonight then Malala so

in New York since the September 11th and
that is are you okay and we pray that
you are and that your family is I'm
sorry to do this to you - it's another

name:Jon Steward

text:entertainment show beginning with a an
overwrought speech of a shaken host and
a television is nothing if not redundant
so I apologize for that it's something
that unfortunately we do for ourselves
so that we can drain whatever abscess is

name:Jon Steward

text:in our hearts and move on to to the
business of making you laugh which which
we haven't been able to do very
effectively lately
[Music]
everyone's checked in already I know

name:Jon Steward

text:we're late I'm sure we're getting in
right under the wire before the cast of
Survivor offers their insight
into what to do in these situations they
said to get back to work and there were
no jobs available for a man in the fetal

name:Jon Steward

text:position under his desk crying which I
gladly would have taken so I so I come
back here
and tonight's show is not obviously a
regular show we look through the ball we
found some clips that we thought might

name:Jon Steward

text:make you smile which is really what's
necessary I think right about now and a
lot of folks have asked me what are you
going to do when you get back
what are you going to say I mean that
jeez what what a terrible thing to have

name:Jon Steward

text:to do and and I don't see it as a burden
at all I I see it as a privilege and I
just I see it as a privilege and
everyone here does see it that way and
this show in general we feel like is a
privilege just even even the idea that

name:Jon Steward

text:we can sit in the back of the country
and make wisecracks which is really what
we do we sit in the back and we throw
spitballs and but never forgetting the
fact that it is a luxury in this country
that allows us to do that that is that

name:Jon Steward

text:is a country that allows for open satire
and I know that sounds basic and it
sounds as though it goes without saying
but that's really what this whole
situation is about it's the difference
between closed and open it's the

name:Jon Steward

text:difference between three and and and and
burdened and we don't take that for
granted here by any stretch of the
imagination Oh
subliminal Bowl is not a punchline
anymore one day it will become that

name:Jon Steward

text:again and and Lord willing it'll become
that again because it means that we have
written out the storm but the main
reason that that I wanted to speak
tonight is is not to tell you what this
show is going to be not to tell you

name:Jon Steward

text:about all the incredibly brave people
that are here in New York and in
Washington and around the country but
but we've had an unendurable pain and I
just I wanted to tell you why I grieved
but why I don't despair

name:Jon Steward

text:luckily we can edit this yeah one of my
first memories is of Martin Luther King
being shot I was five and if you wonder
if this feeling will pass when I was
five he was shot here's what I remember
about it

name:Jon Steward

text:I was in a school in Trenton and they
shot the lights off and we got to sit
under our desks and we thought that was
really cool and they gave us cottage
cheese which was a cold lunch because
there was rioting and we but we didn't

name:Jon Steward

text:know that we just thought my god we get
to sit under our desks and he taught his
cheese and what of and that's what I
remember about it and that was a
tremendous test of this country's fabric
and and this country's had many tests

name:Jon Steward

text:before that and after that and the
reason I don't despair is because this
attack happened
it's not a dream but the aftermath of it
the recovery is a dream realized
and that is Martin Luther King's dream

name:Jon Steward

text:whatever barriers we put up are gone
even if it's just momentary and we're
judging people by not the color of their
skin but the content of the character
and you know all this talk about these
guys are criminal masterminds they've

name:Jon Steward

text:they've gotten together and they've
their extraordinary guile and their wit
and their skill it's it's it's a lie any
fool can blow something up any fool can
destroy but to see these guys these
firefighters these policemen and people

name:Jon Steward

text:from all over the country literally with
buckets rebuilding that that is that's
extraordinary and and and that's why
we've already won
they can't it's it's light it's it's
democracy it's it's we've already won

name:Jon Steward

text:they can't shut that down
they live in chaos and cash it can't
sustain itself it never could
it's too easy and it's too unsatisfying
the view from my apartment
was World Trade Center

name:Jon Steward

text:and now it's gone and they attacked it
this symbol of American ingenuity and
strength and and labor and imagination
and commerce and it is gone but you know
what the view is now Statue of Liberty
the view from the south of Manhattan is

name:Jon Steward

text:now the Statue of Liberty it can't be
done
so we're going to take a break and I'm
going to stop slobbering on myself in
the desk and we're going to get back to
this and it's going to be fun and funny

name:Jon Steward

text:and it's going to be the same as it was
and I thank you moved right back what
Donald Trump has taken the state of
Florida right okay so that's been good
he is now on the he is now on the
doorstep of 270 electoral votes Wow Wow

name:Jon Steward

text:that's a horrifying prospect I can't put
I cannot put a I can't put a happy face
on that and and that's my job
outside of the Civil War World War two
and including 9/11 this may be the most
cataclysmic event the country has ever

name:Jon Steward

text:seen
well here I wouldn't want to be alone
right now
cheers thanks so much for being here
thanks for the news however medic it
might be don't mean any of that

name:Jon Steward

text:no obviously I'm very grateful that
you're here I'm gonna finish this real
you can finish mine too I gotta go back
I don't think I could sit down right now
we still don't know right and we don't
have any idea when it's going to be

name:Jon Steward

text:called okay is there any hold literally
gonna come down like a last kind of
Hawaii and stuff like that because we
never wait for those people well I think
we can agree that this has been an
absolutely exhausting bruise

has come to an ending that I did not
imagine

Comedy Central's World News headquarters
in New York this is the Daily Show with
Jon Stewart Jon Stewart's time behind
the Daily Show desk informed us shaped
our opinions and made us laugh till it

name:Jon Steward

text:hurt the hosts legacy transformed The
Daily Show into a cultural powerhouse
and his best moments will live on long
after his departure so let's enjoy them
Stewart always pointed out political
hypocrisy like the time he showed up his

name:Jon Steward

text:television counterparts on CNN's
crossfire it's interesting to hear you
talk about I felt my responsibility to
the you know I didn't realize that and
maybe this explains quite a bit is that
the news organizations look to Comedy

name:Jon Steward

text:Central for their cues on integrity so
if your idea of confronting me is that I
don't ask hard-hitting enough news
questions mourn bad shape fellas we're
here to love you not confront you no no
but but what I'm saying us is this I I'm

name:Jon Steward

text:not I'm here to confront you because we
need help from the media and they're
hurting us and he never shied away from
important political scandals including
going after New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio
just weeks into his first term in office

name:Jon Steward

text:he comes pizza with a knife and a fork
supposed to be champion in middle class
two weeks into your term and we catch
you eating pizza a lot Trump but Stewart
wasn't always light-hearted his first
show after the attacks on 9/11 became

name:Jon Steward

text:one of his most memorable when Stewart
showed a more emotional side
luckily we can edit this that the host
also had a strong reaction to the grand
jury's decision not to indict a New York
City police officer for the death of

name:Jon Steward

text:Eric garner I think what is so utterly
depressing is that none of the
ambiguities that existed in the Ferguson
case exist in the Staten Island case and
yet the outcome is exactly the same no
crime no trial all harm no foul his

name:Jon Steward

text:ability to get guests from both sides of
the aisle led to some hard-hitting QA
his interview with former defense
secretary Donald Rumsfeld a person he
made fun of often became one of his most
epic moments the group that was assigned

name:Jon Steward

text:the job of coordinating the presentation
about going to war in Iraq met weekly I
guess I don't know it would have been at
a different level
the NSC met free did they tell you
anything yeah he battled with Bill

name:Jon Steward

text:O'Reilly on a regular basis even on a
Riley's own show there is a selective
outrage machine here at Fox that petty
fogs only when it suits the narrative
that suits them and he never back down
when trying to prove a point like in

name:Jon Steward

text:this interview with health care reform
activists Betsy McCoy patients it seems
like this bill is allowing people more
control over their lives and that your
reading of it is hyperbolic and in some
ways this provision is so dangerous

name:Jon Steward

text:that looks like a semicircle this
provision is so dangerous that the
Senate Finance Committee has already
ripped it out of its draft it's not
because it's so dangerous it's because
people so lost their about it

name:Jon Steward

text:Stewart will always be remembered for
his talent skill and guts which he'll
get to share with a very different
audience at dinner time from now on I'm
gonna have a dinner on a school night
with my family who I have heard from

name:Jon Steward

text:multiple sources are lovely people
tomorrow night 11 now I would imagine as
this show is airing there may be
information out there right now that the
audience might not be aware of so I will
just tell you Doug Herzog Michele

name:Jon Steward

text:ganelin of Comedy Central gave me an
incredible opportunity 17 years ago to
pilot this wonderful franchise and I 17
years is the longest I have ever in my
life held a job by 16 years and five
months

name:Jon Steward

text:hey the upshot there being I am a
terrible employee but but in my heart I
know it is time for someone else to have
that opportunity and that none of it
I'm up I'm up that I told you they
didn't know you probably know not right

name:Jon Steward

text:away it's going to be you know we're
still working out details I'm up in
September might be around then might be
December might be July we're still
working out details I don't have any
specific plans got a lot of ideas I got

name:Jon Steward

text:a lot of things in my head I'm gonna
have dinner on a school night with my
family who I have heard from multiple
sources are lovely people you know I I'm
not going to be here and and try and sum
up what this place has meant to me over

name:Jon Steward

text:the years
but I couldn't do that and we have
plenty of time and I've got myriad
people to thank and and and we'll get to
that over time I'm not going anywhere
tomorrow but this show doesn't deserve

name:Jon Steward

text:an even slightly Restless host and
neither do you
I don't think I'm gonna miss being on
television every day I'm gonna miss
coming here every day
and this is where I love the people here

name:Jon Steward

text:they're the best they're creative and
collaborative and
find and and that's a literate of but
it's cheating because it's a K but you
you you you understand what I'm saying
there I love them and respect them so

name:Jon Steward

text:much what is this fluid what are these
feelings huh Frankenstein angry it's
it's been an absolute privilege it's
been the honor of my professional life
and I thank you for for watching it for
hate watching it whatever reason you are

name:Jon Steward

text:tuning in for it you get in this
business with the idea that maybe you
have a point of view and something to
express and to receive feedback from
that is the greatest feeling I can ask
for and I thank you

name:Jon Steward

text:you
and now here's your host for the 80th
annual Academy Awards jobs steward
you're here I can't believe it you're
actually here this is exciting ladies
and gentlemen good evening

name:Jon Steward

text:what an exciting night these past three
and a half months have been very tough
town was torn apart by a bitter writer
strike but I'm happy to say that the
fight is over
so tonight tonight

name:Jon Steward

text:welcome to the makeup sex
of course there is still obviously some
collateral damage left over from the
strike emotionally economically perhaps
worst of all the cancellation of the
legendary Vanity Fair Oscar party they

name:Jon Steward

text:said they did it out of quote respect
for the writers and oh you know another
way that could show respect for the
writers maybe one day invites some of
them to the Vanity Fair Oscar party they
would enjoy it

name:Jon Steward

text:don't worry they won't mingle don't
worry they actually say that having the
Oscars help to end the strike that the
idea that getting the town back to work
and having an Oscars was one of the
impetus to to get things done which i

name:Jon Steward

text:think is wonderful so if we could before
we spend the next 4 to 5 hours giving
each other golden statues let's take a
moment to congratulate ourselves tonight
we look beyond the dark days to focus on
happier fare this year's slate of Oscar

name:Jon Steward

text:nominated psychopathic killer movies
does this town need a hug what what what
happened No Country for Old Men Sweeney
Todd there will be blood all I can say
is thank God for teen pregnancy ya know
I made the country agrees

name:Jon Steward

text:everybody up they needed that kind of
light-hearted fare there were if I may
amazing performances this year and I
think everybody can agree on that there
really were this terrific
Daniel day-lewis remarkable Cate

name:Jon Steward

text:Blanchett twice my friend Javier Bardem
Javier Bardem is Anton Chigurh
remarkable your work in No Country for
Old Men combining brilliantly Hannibal
Lecter's murderous ness with Dorothy
Hamels wedge cut it was

name:Jon Steward

text:Julie Christie was absolutely amazing
and away from her brilliant movie was a
moving story of a woman who forgets her
own husband Hillary Clinton called it
the feel-good movie of the year
Diablo Cody what an amazing story she

name:Jon Steward

text:wrote Juno such a great movie
Diablo Cody used to be an exotic dancer
and now she's an oscar-nominated
screenwriter I hope you're enjoying the
pay cut it is I don't know if you know
this but if you want to find out your

is take your pet's name and the street
you grew up on so that makes my stripper

Democrats do have an historic race going
Hillary Clinton versus Barack Obama

name:Jon Steward

text:normally when you see a black man or a
woman president an asteroid is about to
hit the Statue of Liberty
how will we know it's the future
I'm excited we have a good show for
tonight and I'm excited about my guest

name:Jon Steward

text:Selma director Ava Duvernay and this
movie is phenomenal you have to see it
we're very excited to have her but first
you know I think we'd all agree 2014 was
not a great year for people ah but I
think the hope was that 2015 would bring

name:Jon Steward

text:sort of a respite from the kinds of
terrible events that have become all too
familiar for us but but our hearts are
with the staff of Charlie Hebdo and
their families tonight I know very few
people go into comedy you know as an act

name:Jon Steward

text:of courage mainly because it shouldn't
have to be that it shouldn't be an act
of courage it should be taken as
established law but those guys had had
Bo had it and they were killed for their
cartoons a stark reminder that for the

name:Jon Steward

text:most part the legislators and
journalists and institutions that we jab
in ridicule are not in any way the enemy
for however frustrating or outrage the
back and forth can become it's still
back and forth a conversation amongst

name:Jon Steward

text:those on let's call it team civilization
and this type of violence only clarifies
that reality but of course of course our
goal tonight is not to make sense of
this because there is no sense to be
made of this our goal as it is always is

name:Jon Steward

text:to keep going keep calm and carry on or
whatever version of that saying is is in
your dorm room
you
you know for the for the past couple of
nights here on the program we've been

name:Jon Steward

text:dealing with the fallout from the grand
jury decision in Missouri failing to
indict the officer responsible for the
the shooting death of Michael Brown we
did our best here to process those
events even enjoyed actually a bit of

name:Jon Steward

text:fun at the expense of the st. Louis Rams
in st. Louis police association Twitter
war and I know I know doing those bits
helps no one other than maybe us here at
the show individually as a creative
outlet a catharsis a way of processing

name:Jon Steward

text:emotion that might otherwise be
undigested by the way that process
brought to you by Arby's Arby's do you
think pain and grief are hard to digest
but anyway at least that process has
begun and we were glad to be able to

name:Jon Steward

text:move forward ever so slowly hoping that
we might as a country have a respite
from these types of in justices and we
did have a respite for maybe Oh what
time is it no indictment in the death of
Eric garner a grand jury in New York

name:Jon Steward

text:City has decided not to charge a white
New York City police officer in the
death of an unarmed african-american man
III don't know i reaiiy honestly don't
know what to say if if comedy is tragedy
plus time I need more time but I would

name:Jon Steward

text:really settle for less tragedy to be
honest with you you know I think what is
so utterly depressing is that none of
the ambiguities that existed in the
Ferguson case exist in the Staten Island
case and yet the outcome is exactly the

name:Jon Steward

text:same no crime no trial all harm no foul
in Ferguson at least you had conflicting
witness testimony had conflicting
forensics you had the specter at least
of police self-defense but here there is
none of that the coroner called it a

name:Jon Steward

text:homicide the guy's not acting
threatening and we know that not through
witness testimony unreliable bystanders
but because we are watching it someone
taped it
a couple of days ago the White House

name:Jon Steward

text:proposed more cameras on cop fest as a
solution to this type of violence I
assume that the solution they're
proposing if implemented would look
something like the Eric garner case
I mean maybe to look at the bright side

name:Jon Steward

text:we're about to save ourselves a load of
money on cop camera bus but damn we are
definitely not living in a post-racial
society and I can imagine there are a
lot of people out there wondering how
much of a society we're living in at all

name:Jon Steward

text:and that's our show
so cha-cha-cha ah yeah
I don't know I don't know what to say I
did it just happened so I I have not had
a chance to really digest it I'm gonna
need a segue I'm gonna need a little

name:Jon Steward

text:piece of video footage to change the
mood here
[Applause]
[Applause]
okay it's nice I like it although in my
current frame of mind I can't help but

name:Jon Steward

text:wonder oh of course the white cats
getting massaged
[Applause]
[Laughter]
you
before we get started before I get

name:Jon Steward

text:started I I just wanted to say a few
things first of all this is surreal for
me I'm not gonna lie growing up in the
dusty streets of South Africa I never
dreamed that I would one day have well
two things really and indoor toilets and

name:Jon Steward

text:a job as host of The Daily Show and and
now and now I have both and and I'm
quite comfortable with one of them so
you know but the truth is now I'm in the
chair and I can only assume that this is
a strange for you as it is for me

name:Jon Steward

text:you know John Stuart was more than just
a late-night host he was often our voice
our refuge and in many ways our
political dead and it's weird because
dad has left and now and now it feels
like the family has a new stepdad and

name:Jon Steward

text:he's black
which is not ideal I also know that many
people have questions for example why
isn't a woman hosting the show because
surely it's about time well it turns out
that Comedy Central did ask women to

name:Jon Steward

text:host and the woman they asked turned the
job down because they will have better
things to do and clearly knew something
I didn't also why didn't they get an
American to host and again Comedy
Central tried and those people also

name:Jon Steward

text:declined and so once more a job
Americans rejected is now being done by
an immigrant
you know many people are part of the
reason that I'm sitting here today but

saying the Pope is a huge that was a
joke I'm saying and what a waste how

name:Jon Steward

text:much could the Pope really do in one
weekend would he have a really lasting
effect on America well the truth is he
did the beltway bombshell House Speaker
John Boehner of roughly resigning from
Congress the move comes a day after

name:Jon Steward

text:Boehner a devout Catholic welcome the
Pope to the US Capitol know why leave
now I just got here a lot of fancy suits
and a new set and I learned how to
pronounce your name Boehner
now I know this wasn't the biggest news

name:Jon Steward

text:of the weekend I mean there was huge
news out there blood-red moon the tragic
Fetty WAP accident hashtag pray for fede
and of course the Mets made the playoffs
I don't know what that is but John told
me would work now to understand why

name:Jon Steward

text:Boehner leaving is such a big deal you
have to understand what a big deal
Boehner was the Speaker controls the
floor of the house and if you can't
bring anything up without really his
say-so that's right you cannot make a

name:Jon Steward

text:law in America without the speaker's
approval John Boehner has final say
about which laws come in and which laws
don't he's basically the bouncer at club
Congress which is which is probably the
worst club ever I'm here yeah first of

name:Jon Steward

text:all there's hardly any woman in the club
there's always a bunch of old guys
talking about laying pipe oh and and
everyone at the club has AIDS
that's aids the people that help you the
Pew are just two legs

name:Jon Steward

text:sir loser speaker as effective as
Boehner must have been crushing for the
Republicans I mean he helped enact
budget cuts that for the first time in
decades decreased federal spending for
two years in a row he made most of the

name:Jon Steward

text:Bush tax cuts permanent and he deported
Taco Tuesdays from the cafeteria menu
you know who had a tough job Republican
candidate Marco Rubio who had to break
the bad news to a room of conservatives
just a few minutes ago Speaker Boehner

name:Jon Steward

text:announced that he will be resigning
[Applause]
nope okay that that did not go how I
thought and just by the way that that
right there that is the face of a man
who's not used to getting applause well

name:Jon Steward

text:let me explain to you Rubio no they have
not made you popular overnights that was
last weekend's value voters summit a
gathering of some of the radical
conservatives who shut down the
government over Obamacare in 2013 and

name:Jon Steward

text:the same people who wanted to shut it
down again over Planned Parenthood this
very week and for Boehner this was the
last straw
throughout his nearly five-year tenure
he's struggled with a fractured and more

name:Jon Steward

text:conservative Republican caucus Boehner
has clashed with unruly hardline
conservatives who felt he was too
willing to compromise what they meant is
at all willing to compromise you see for
this faction even John Boehner the man

name:Jon Steward

text:once ranked the eighth most conservative
men and men in Congress wasn't
right-wing enough it's like a crack
telling myth that it's not addictive
enough oh man you got to step your game
up crystal you made teeth fall out big

name:Jon Steward

text:deal now Whitney Houston too soon
so the radicals finally got what they
wanted John Boehner is very tan head on
a plate and now that the turmoil is all
over
what is the results torn wall is gonna

name:Jon Steward

text:get a lot worse and even worse climate
more and not less confrontational the
next speaker which is going to face the
same problems that Boehner did the same
problems that include a hair-trigger set
of tear ducts that go off anytime a

name:Jon Steward

text:child picks a flower form unless we go
to senior congressional correspondent
Jordan Klepper everyone
what's next for the outgoing speaker
look a man like Boehner is going to have
a lot of options we're down the hill as

name:Jon Steward

text:he's thinking of becoming a professional
onion slicer obviously he'd be great as
a seat filler at a funeral or Claire
Danes impersonator and I guess more
importantly Jordan what are you hearing
about who'll replace Boehner I mean wow

name:Jon Steward

text:those are big shoes to fill
oh well I'm sure they'll find someone
extremely qualified yeah Jordan but this
is John Boehner
I mean whoever takes that job will
probably fall flat on their face in

name:Jon Steward

text:front of the entire nation yeah I get
how you're feeling you know taking over
for John Boehner is hard you know it
doesn't have to be a disaster I don't
know about that Jordan I can already
hear everyone saying the thing John

nostalgic for the old leader but maybe

contest branded Ziggy's not what it used
to be but um you know and I think
Garfield's been coasting for a long time
Family Circus no those aren't even jokes
it's like an actual circus it seeks to

name:Jon Steward

text:entertain but it really just fills you
with sadness that's so what kind of
cartoon contest there as if I don't know
would provoke such a violent reaction a
group called American freedom Defense
Initiative notorious for its anti

name:Jon Steward

text:Islamic views hosting this awards
ceremony to give more than ten thousand
dollars to the best cartoon depicting
the Prophet Mohammed Oh see that is
crazy ten thousand dollars to a
cartoonist that's like five years salary

name:Jon Steward

text:that cartoonists could almost consider
quitting their two other jobs at two
different cold brew coffee shops well
that you know that that's that group
afdi that's the same group that led
protests against the the so called

name:Jon Steward

text:Ground Zero mosque and has been
plastering New York subways with anti
Islamic advertisements afdi is a First
Amendment Guth the same way people from
Philly or sports fans ostensibly they
like sports but really they're just

name:Jon Steward

text:looking for an excuse to punch a
stranger and pour beer on someone's baby
so but even so even so I can't believe
we have to reiterate this it is not okay
to shoot other people because you are
offended by what they draw even if they

name:Jon Steward

text:drew it to offend
you know shooting of them really don't
like them you cannot shoot people okay
yeah fine
you cannot shoot people you cannot shoot
people because you don't share their

name:Jon Steward

text:opinions you cannot shoot people even if
they offend you what if what am I like
haven't shot anyone in a long time
no still not okay okay
not even if those people specifically
set out to provoke you responding to

name:Jon Steward

text:cartoons or words or ideas with violence
is wrong it's but what if someone is
creating a climate of hate and
intolerance by appealing to people's
basest fears because then you just got
it no you can't no no the violence just

unbeliever and the US military is
towards Texas they send a
lieutenant-colonel
to a local Texas Town Hall to waste his
tires all we want to do is make sure

name:Jon Steward

overseas it is a preparation for martial

what you say

Greg Abbott ordered the Texas State
Guard to monitor military personnel
movements and training exercise
schedules and ensure that safety and
constitutional rights of Texans were not

infamous Chainsaw Massacre I mean Texas
it's not as if I don't find it adorable
that your governor thinks your State

name:Jon Steward

text:Guard could take on the United States
military it's like a little dog growling
at a big dog for an eight-year-old
picking a fight with the predator but
but enough of the fear-mongering you
know these types of exercises have been

name:Jon Steward

text:going on in Texas for years right
maybe here all my yeah in Texas his
operation roaming sands in fact the 2001
roaming sands operation was the largest
exercise of its kind in history but did
then pre oops Governor Rick Perry start

name:Jon Steward

text:spreading fear about a Texas
takeover he did not Texas was fine with
the concept of widespread military
operations in their state in the 2000
alts I don't know what's changed since
then it's alright America elected a

ineffective Harvard schooled

warlock so Texas it appears it appears
you are on the verge of being taken over
by Isis or the United States of America

you make it just remind yourself and I
ever thought I'd be saying this what
would Rick Perry do
you
in the reptile kingdom iguanas are king

name:Jon Steward

text:but the big question is do they
I'm I'm sorry sir are you are you lost
no I can't wait it's me Trevor and they
papa
this is this is this is Cole wait wait
wait are you gonna take the show back oh

name:Jon Steward

text:man I heard about this in American TV
show trust me trust me a thousand times
no actually I have this issue I care
about it very deeply and I was running
you know I want to get some attention
paid to it but I was realizing that I

name:Jon Steward

text:don't have a show and nobody gives it
anymore so I thought you have a show and
maybe I could come and hey I'm here for
you John
my show is your show my phone
yeah you can I understand I understand

name:Jon Steward

text:it's that's good well I just want so so
back in 2010 okay
after far more lobbying than should have
ever been necessary Congress passed what
was called as a drug act funded
healthcare for 911 first responders

name:Jon Steward

text:who'd gotten sick working at Ground Zero
after the funny story the government
told them that the air was safe but it
gave them cancer death so you're here to
celebrate the anniversary that no no
they actually only funded there's a drug

name:Jon Steward

text:act five years they said they wanted to
make sure that the program wouldn't have
people that tried to cheat it and that
you could scientifically prove a link
between the the responders horrible
diseases and the toxic air that they

name:Jon Steward

text:were breathing day in and day out
working at Ground Zero I see and you
hear because they couldn't prove the
link well they actually no they proved
the life I see but there was a lot of
fraud there was no fraud there was no

name:Jon Steward

text:father so no reason to not renew it
permanently you're not from around here
are you of course there was no reason
not to renew it permanently but they did
not renew it anyway it expired in
September it's soon gonna be out of

name:Jon Steward

text:money these first responders many sick
with cancers and pulmonary disease have
had to travel at their own expense
Washington DC hundreds of times to plead
for our government to do the right thing
plead oh I see so you here to tell us

name:Jon Steward

text:that once Congress saw the first
responders obviously their renewed vigor
came in and they renewed the health care
funding and they made its permanence
that's what you saying right you're not
from around here they have not done that

name:Jon Steward

text:that doesn't make sense just you I know
the only conclusion that I can draw is
that the people of Congress are not as
good of people as the people who are
First Responder
oh well John now you can't say that

name:Jon Steward

text:because how would you know last week I
had the distinct honor of accompanying
some of these heroes on one of their
many trips down to the Capitol to see
how in God's name this is in any way a
controversial or non priority issue it's

name:Jon Steward

text:easy to take our democracy for granted
but be in Washington and see it
firsthand is truly humbling I'm here in
the Senate building the Russell building
to witness the majesty of our nation's
legislative process the beauty the

name:Jon Steward

text:intelligence the compassion and I'm just
with you
we're here to see if shame works shame
and emotions one might experience if say
you were a senator who tweeted after
9/11 we will never forget our heroes but

name:Jon Steward

text:forgot them by not signing on to this
bill we just had to pay those senators a
visit and deliver the shame we're just
going to stop by Rand Paul's office real

wondering if senator Johnson is home

name:Jon Steward

be appropriate to be upset with yes sir

arrange it John oh who can I follow up

name:Jon Steward

text:JON STEWART, EVERYONE!
as all of you know today is September
11th and as humans we all have our own
way of processing what happened that day
but as we know in life there are humans
and then this President Trump and this

name:Jon Steward

text:morning the nation's leader sends out a
heartfelt tweet that read 17 years since
September 11th exclamation points
now this tweet upsets a lot of people
because on days such as this part of any
president's job really is to articulate

name:Jon Steward

text:the mood of the nation
whereas this tweet looks like it was
ghost written by a calendar and and I'll
be honest like I think we should give
the guy some credit first of all he
didn't say they will find people on both

name:Jon Steward

text:sides so that's progress and secondly
the president was not wrong it is
September 11th that happened 17 years
ago right which means this is the most
factually accurate thing Trump has
tweeted about in about three months

name:Jon Steward

text:[Applause]
and besides compared to what Trump
normally says about 9/11 today's tweet
was a huge step in the right direction
you know which puts his pedometer at one
because Trump has never been able to

name:Jon Steward

text:talk about 9/11 on Twitter or in real
life without being totally weird about
it like today's tweet was much better
than the 9/11 tweet he sent out in 2013
Trump tweeted quote I would like to
extend my best wishes to all even the

name:Jon Steward

text:haters and losers on this special date
September 11th now you see that I don't
even know where to start all right
best wishes haters and losers special
date like it starts out sounding like a
wedding invitation then it becomes a

name:Jon Steward

text:diss track and then it ends as a birth
announcement that's what it felt like
like Trump tried to commemorate 9/11 and
then he ended up writing the world's
most confusing Hallmark card that's what
it was

name:Jon Steward

text:and and it turns out it turns out this
isn't a recent phenomenon right Trump
has been saying bizarre emotionally
out-of-step shit about 9/11 since 9/11
on the day it happened
most people were thinking is my family

name:Jon Steward

text:okay could could this be the start of
World War three Donald Trump on the
other hand was more concerned with
bragging rights you have one of the
landmark buildings down in the financial
district 40 Wall Street did you have any

name:Jon Steward

text:damage or did you know what's happened
down there
40 Wall Street actually was the second
tallest building in downtown Manhattan
and it was actually before the World
Trade Center was the tallest and then

name:Jon Steward

text:when they built the World Trade Center
became known as the second tallest and
now it's the tallest okay so just so
we're on the same page here two
buildings have just collapsed and
Trump's reaction is I now have the

name:Jon Steward

text:tallest building in downtown Manhattan
that is not a normal thing to say like
imagine if after the Japanese bombed
Pearl Harbor FDR was like December 7th
1941 a date when my boat became the
biggest boat in all of Hawaii it was a

name:Jon Steward

text:pretty cool day actually some would call
it da bomb and by the way by the way
this was all before Donald Trump started
running for presidents right once he got
on the campaign trail his track record
of talking about 9/11 went from weird to

name:Jon Steward

text:downright hateful there were people over
in New Jersey that were watching it a
heavy Arab population that were cheering
as the buildings came down not good hey
I watched when the World Trade Center
came tumbling down and I watched in

name:Jon Steward

text:Jersey City New Jersey where thousands
and thousands of people were cheering as
that building was coming down okay now
this is a proven lie right there were
never thousands of Arabs in New Jersey
celebrating the towers coming down but

name:Jon Steward

text:to be fair we do know that Trump suffers
from a rare medical condition that
causes him to see large crowds where
there were none
it makes sense oh and and his lives
about nine nine eleven didn't stop there

name:Jon Steward

text:right because once he put New Jersey
Arabs into the story he was like wait I
want to be in the story too in our
darkest moments as a city we showed the
world the very best of America the
firefighters and first responders and

name:Jon Steward

text:the police officers and the Port
Authority workers everyone who helped
clear the rubble and I was there and I
watched and I helped a little bit but I
want to tell you those people were
amazing I'm sorry what how do you help

name:Jon Steward

text:with 9/11 a little bit but you either
help or you don't what did he go up to a
cop and be like hey officer you got a
little schmutz right there all right
I've done my part good luck everybody I
look I can't say for sure that he's

name:Jon Steward

text:lying
I'm just suspicious of someone who says
that because Trump has never taken a
little credit for anything right if he
had helped at all he would have been
like I cleaned up all of 9/11 folks I

name:Jon Steward

text:was the first and last responder all by
myself I also struggled to believe that
someone who was helping can't remember
what day it was
it's very close to my heart because I
was down there and I watched our police

name:Jon Steward

text:and our firemen down on 7-eleven down
the World Trade Center right after it
came down
7:11 how do you mess up the dates of an
event named after the dates you just
have to remember three numbers like I

name:Jon Steward

text:wonder what happens when he has an
emergency hello police
it's an emergency what 7-eleven oh I
doubt seven one well as long as I have
you let me get a scorpion and wrinkly
hot dog please honestly trump is so bad

name:Jon Steward

text:with 911 it feels like at some point in
his presidency he's gonna mix it up
completely with a different holiday and
like I wouldn't be shocked if he shows
up to ground zero in a Halloween costume
all right

name:Jon Steward

text:although knowing Trump he just roll with
it he'd be like I'm wishing everyone a
spooktacular 9/11 look what I'm saying
is all things considered I understand
this tweet from today might have pissed
off some people but it's not really that

name:Jon Steward

text:bad in fact it's probably Trump's best
9/11 observance yet and if you don't
think so you're a hater and a loser

the wall it's not only one of the lead

president Trump's most famous campaign
promise now according to trump the wall
is almost completely built and America
is safer than ever before but at the

yes Jesus listen to Beyonce because he
knew the future that's the whole point

name:Jon Steward

text:of the joke now don't forget just a
month ago when Republicans still
controlled all of Congress Trump
couldn't get funding for his wall so
with the Democrats in the house it's no
surprise that the situation has

name:Jon Steward

Washington and Trump's shutdown enters
its third week 17 days and Counting as
president Trump refuses to back down on
his budget demand of 5 billion dollars
for a border war with Mexico and the

Democrats standing firm that no taxpayer
dollars be used to build a wall the

ineffective border wall on Friday he

may last months or even years if we have
to stay out for a very long period of
time we're going to do that Wow the
shutdown could keep going for years
I bet Trump is just hoping that if it

America can't afford to have another
election and then he can just keep being
presidents like unfortunately there's
not enough money for an election folks
we only have the funds to print one

for chester Cheetah anyone who wears
sunglasses inside is cool enough to be

shutdowns is that if they end quickly
there's not much harm that is done right

effects are I think of it like this if
you leave your cats at home alone for
the weekend they may not love it but
they'll be fine though just like drink
toilet water or something

you're gonna need some new cats right

text:welcome to the Late Show
this is our first show on the air sense
of New York and Washington were attacked
and I need to ask your patience and
indulgence here because I want to say a
few things and believe me sadly I'm not

name:Jon Steward

text:going to be saying anything new and in
the past week others have said what I
will be saying here tonight far more
eloquently than I'm equipped to do but
if we are going to continue to do shows
I just need to hear myself talk for a

name:Jon Steward

text:couple of minutes and so that's what I'm
gonna do here it's terribly sad here in
New York City
we've lost 5,000 fellow New Yorkers and
you can feel it you can feel it you can
see it it's terribly sad terribly

name:Jon Steward

text:terribly sad and watching all of this I
wasn't sure that I should be doing a
television show because for 20 years
we've been in the city making fun of
everything making fun of the city making
fun of my hair making fun of Paul well

name:Jon Steward

text:so to come to this circumstance that is
so desperately sad I and I don't trust
my judgment in matters like this but
I'll tell you the reason that I am doing
a show on the reason I am back to work
is because of Mayor Giuliani 20 years

name:Jon Steward

text:that we've been here in New York City
we've worked closely with the police
officers and and the firefighters and
and unfortunately most of us don't
really have to think too much about what
these men and women do on a daily basis

name:Jon Steward

text:and and the phrase New York's finest and
New York's bravest you know did it mean
anything to us personally firsthand
well maybe hopefully but probably not
but boy it means something now doesn't
it they they put themselves in harm's

name:Jon Steward

text:way to protect people like us and the
men and women from the firefighters and
the police department who are lost are
going to be missed by this city for a
very very long time and I am I hope for
for myself and everybody else not only

name:Jon Steward

text:in New York but everywhere is that we
never ever take these people for granted
absolutely never take them for granted
I just want to go through this and again
forgive me if this is more for me than
than it is for people watching I'm sorry

name:Jon Steward

text:but I just I have to go through this I'm
the reason we were attacked the reason
these people are dead there these people
are missing and dead and they weren't
doing anything wrong they were living
their lives they were going to work they

name:Jon Steward

text:were traveling they were doing what they
normally do as I understand it and and
my understanding of this is vague at
best another smaller group of people
stole some airplanes and crashed them
into buildings and and we're told that

name:Jon Steward

text:they were zealots fueled by religious
fervor religious fervor and if you live
to be a thousand years old will that
make any sense to you will that make any
goddamn sense I'll tell you about a
thing that happened last night is a town

name:Jon Steward

text:in Montana by the name of Chouteau it's
about a hundred miles south of the
Canadian border
and I know a little something about this
town and it's 1600 people 1,600 people
and it's a AG business community which

name:Jon Steward

text:means farming and ranching and Montana
has been in the middle of a drought
floor I don't know three years and if
you got no rain you can't grow anything
and if you can't grow anything you can't
farm and if you can't grow anything you

name:Jon Steward

text:can't ranch because the cattle don't
have anything to eat and that's the way
life is in this small town 1600 people
last night at the High School Auditorium
in Shoto Montana
they had a rally home of the Bulldogs by

name:Jon Steward

text:the way they they had a rally for New
York City and not just a rally for New
York City but a rally to raise money to
raise money for New York City and and if
that doesn't tell you everything you
need to know about the the spirit of the

name:Jon Steward

text:United States then I can't help you I'm
sorry
and I have one one more thing to say and
then thank God Regis is here so we have
something to make fun of if if you if
you didn't if you didn't believe it

name:Jon Steward

text:before and it's easy to understand how
you might have been skeptical on this
point if you didn't believe it before
you can absolutely believe it now New
York City is the greatest city in the
world

White House they are not King Joffrey's
goons so I'm so glad you guys are all
here tonight to honor a great American

hammered that's not who I really am

wish she was because issue if she was

okay enough about how slytherin we are
here to talk about the truth
it is 2017 and we are living in the
Golden Age of lying now's the time to be
a liar and Donald Trump is liar in chief

name:Jon Steward

text:and remember you guys our public enemy
number one
you are his biggest enemy journalist
Isis normal life ties
and somehow you're the bad guys that's
why you got to keep your foot on the gas

name:Jon Steward

text:especially with Sean Spicer who is not
here tonight because I think he's at
home googling how to fake his own death
but I love it when you give it to Sean
Spicer Sean Spicer gives press briefings
like someone is going through his

name:Jon Steward

text:browser history while he watched his
just panic like no wait stop it stop it
stop it
stop taking your head stop taking your
head stop shaking your head we'll talk
about this tomorrow

name:Jon Steward

text:it is the best now you guys are laughing
but realize Sean Spicer has been doing
PR since 1999 he has been doing this job
for 18 years and somehow after 18 years
his go-to move when you ask them a tough
question is denying the Holocaust that

name:Jon Steward

text:is insane how many people do you know
that can turn a press briefing into a
full-on Mel Gibson traffic stop
only the spice man only the spice man
you know what's crazy every day on The
Daily Show we do these jokes all the

name:Jon Steward

text:time we're like the administration lives
from flip flops it doesn't matter
his supporters still trust him it has
not stopped his momentum at all it's
almost as if the daily show should be on
c-span it has left zero impact

name:Jon Steward

text:it was true and I realized something
maybe it's because we're living in this
strange time where trust is more
important than truth and supporters of
President Trump trust him and I know
journalists you guys are definitely

name:Jon Steward

text:trying to do good work I just think that
a lot of people don't trust you right
now and can you blame them I mean unlike
Anderson Cooper's bone structure you
guys have been far from perfect
remember election night I mean that was

name:Jon Steward

text:your Steve Harvey Miss Universe moment
the look on your face is at 11:00 p.m.
on election night it was like walking
into a Panera Bread and finding out your
sixth grade teacher has a part-time job
there I was like what mr. legend

name:Jon Steward

text:I guess you don't have all the answers
cuz it was all fun and games with Obama
right you were covering the adult who
could speak English and now you're
covering President Trump so you got to
take your game to a whole new level it's

name:Jon Steward

text:like if a bunch of stripper cops had to
solve a real-life murder Fox News is
here I'm amazed you guys even showed up
how are you here in public it's hard to
trust you guys when you backed a man
like Bill O'Reilly for years but it

name:Jon Steward

text:finally happened Bill O'Reilly has been
fired but then you gave him a twenty
five million dollar severance package
making it the only package he won't
force a woman to touch now in a
Raleigh's defense he was told by a close

MSNBC is here tonight and I'm glad you
guys are here tonight that way if I'm
bombing Brian Williams will describe it

name:Jon Steward

text:as stunning music it's hard to trust you
guys when you send us so many mixed
messages on one hand you tell us the
prison industrial complex is the problem
and then you air five straight hours of
lockup you can't be mad at corporations

name:Jon Steward

text:profiting off of minorities in prison
when you're a corporation profiting off
of minorities in prison it's like I have
one quick request MSNBC please tell
Rachel Maddow to chill about Trump stack
return tax returns I don't know what you

name:Jon Steward

text:think you'll find in there but there
isn't going to be a line item that just
says bribes from Russia that's not how
it works you're like oh I found the
10/40 USSR it doesn't work like that
you're the liberal news outlet like we

name:Jon Steward

text:dressed the same I look like a melanin
version of Chris Hayes I want to root
for you guys but you're turning into
conspiracy theorists every night you're
like the Russians act our elections the
Russians hacked our elections meanwhile

name:Jon Steward

do tell MSNBC just pump the brakes we're
only on day a hundred by the end of the
year you guys all gonna have ten foil

name:Jon Steward

text:hats and jars of urine all over your
desks now I had a lot more MSNBC jokes
but I don't want to just ramble on

last but not least my favorite
entertainment channel is in the building

name:Jon Steward

text:tonight CNN is here baby
now you guys got some really weird trust
issues going on with the public I'm not
going to call you fake news but

reality TV show CNN tonight should just
be called wait a second now hold on stop

name:Jon Steward

Trumper Russian spy I don't know you

name:Jon Steward

text:tell me tweet us at ac360 no you tell me
I'm watching the news but it feels like
I'm watching CNN what's the news
please just take a network figure out
what you want to say then go um be here
but whenever I turn you guys on it feels

name:Jon Steward

text:like a little kid just ran into the room
it's trying to tell you a story
there's a lot to breathe take a minute
drink some milk then tell us the story
wolf I know I'm busting balls I don't I
don't have a solution on how to win back

name:Jon Steward

text:trust
I don't but in the age of Trump I know
that you guys have to be more perfect
now more than ever because you are how
the president gets his news
not from advisers not from experts not

name:Jon Steward

text:from intelligence agencies you guys so
that's why you gotta be on your a-game
you gotta be twice as good you can't
make any mistakes because when one of
you messes up he blames your entire
group and now you know what it feels

name:Jon Steward

text:like to be a minority
and I can see some of you guys
complaining like what I gotta work twice
as hard for half the credit remember
you're a minority you guys got a lot
more experience than me but I got three

name:Jon Steward

text:decades of being brown so if you want to
survive the age of Trump you got to
think like a minority and now that
you're minority oh man
everyone is going to expect you to be
the mouthpiece for the entire group so I

name:Jon Steward

text:hate to say it but somewhere right now
all of you being represented by Geraldo
Rivera see now that you're a truly
minority there's a distorted version of
you out there you know Taco Bell for
Mexican culture Panda Express for

name:Jon Steward

text:Chinese culture Huffington Post for
journalism
and then when you actually manage to do
great work you get hit with the most
condescending line in the English
language

name:Jon Steward

text:hey you're actually one of the good ones
then you have to smile and say thank you
kind of sucks doesn't it by the way you
guys don't really minorities you guys
are super white but I could say Ms NBC
behind we got our minority card no uh

name:Jon Steward

text:but your work is invaluable and I mean
that as a fake journalist I am rooting
for you we're a hundred days in 1360
days to go you guys are running the
marathon and I'm at the half mile
marketing you take for your nipples so

name:Jon Steward

text:I'm wishing you nothing but the best
you chafe man you love chafed
it's a long way to go this this has been
one of the strangest events I have ever
done in my life to be honest with you
like I feel like I'm a tribute in The

name:Jon Steward

text:Hunger Games like if this goes poorly
Steve Bannon gets to eat me but I was
asked to not roast the president and
administration in their absentia and I
completely understand that we are in a
very strange situation where there is a

name:Jon Steward

text:very combative relationship between the
press and the president but now that you
guys are minorities just for this moment
you might understand the position I was
in it and it's the same position a lot
of minority kids feel in this country

name:Jon Steward

text:and it's you know do I come up here and
just try to fit in and not ruffle any
feathers or do I say how I really feel
because this event is about celebrating
the First Amendment and free speech free
speech is the foundation of an open and

name:Jon Steward

text:liberal democracy from college campuses
to the White House only in America can a
first-generation Indian American Muslim
kid get on this stage and make fun of
the President
the orange man behind the Muslim ban and

name:Jon Steward

text:it's a sign to the rest of the world
it's this amazing tradition that shows
the entire world that even the president
is not beyond the reach of the First
Amendment
but the president didn't show up because

name:Jon Steward

text:Donald Trump doesn't care about free
speech
the man who tweets everything that
enters his head refuses to acknowledge
the amendment that allows him to do it
think about it it's almost what is at

name:Jon Steward

text:11:00 it's 11:00 p.m. right now in four
hours Donald Trump will be tweeting
about how bad Nicki Minaj bombed at this
dinner and he'll be doing it completely
sober and that's his right and I'm proud
that all of us are here tonight to

name:Jon Steward

text:defend that right even if the man in the
White House never would so I'd like to
thank the White House Correspondents
Association for having me here I want to
thank all of you I want to thank
Woodward and Bernstein for an inspiring

name:Jon Steward

text:a generation of journalists and I would
like to thank Donald Trump for inspiring
the next thank you so much it's been an
honor good night I love you thank you
thank you I really appreciate it thank

that people in this room covered this
past year was the Republican failure to
recap to the White House hard to believe
the Republicans didn't fare better in
the election with the support of

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:celebrities like Ted Nugent and meatloaf
I guess they overestimated the number of
voters who still drive carpeted vans
but the Republican Party is on the mend
one rising star on the right is Senator
Marco Rubio or as he's known in the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:Republican Party our black guy yeah by
the way as of today the US Senate has a
record number of african-american
senators - - in other words there are

marriage the liberal justice favorite
while the conservatives oppose any
lifelong sacred union between two men
unless of course it's Antonin Scalia and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:Clarence Thomas
the hell was that it's no surprise that
Speaker John Boehner isn't here tonight
Speaker Boehner and President Obama are
still struggling to get along President
Obama and John Boehner are kind of like

name:Hasan Minhaj

Rachel Maddow in theory they understand
each other's positions but deep down you
know nothing's ever going to happen
speaking nothing happening we're all
hoping of course that nothing happens

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:with North Korea and that got me
wondering what is with Kim jong-un now
in the past we've had really scary
enemies like Saddam Hussein and Hitler
now suddenly our nemesis is a pouty
teenage boy who dresses like Rosie

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:O'Donnell at the Emmys Kim jong-un
doesn't understand that we aren't afraid
of him what that guy doesn't get is that
we already have an unstable peninsula
that will ultimately bring down America
it's called Florida yes it is yes

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:President Obama has a lot on his plate
right now he's now at that very nice
stage where there are no more secrets
left to come out about him we all know
that as a child he lived in Indonesia he
studied at a Muslim seminary and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:occasionally ate dog so clearly from the
beginning he was a kid who had his eyes
set on the US presidency
check check and check here I come now I
know the relationship between the
president and the press can seem a bit

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:strained at times some in this room have
even accused the president of being
distant and aloof when I asked the
president about it earlier he said oh
and then walked away of course it's only
natural but mr. president your

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:re-election was a little less excited in
the first time around in 2008 on
election night in 2008 you celebrated
with hundreds of thousands of people in
Chicago's Grant Park it was fascinated
this time around you split a char dog

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:with David Axelrod at the Wiener circle
it just didn't have the same buzz and by
the way I have a question and I think
some of you also have this question it's
been several months since you were
re-elected sir so I'm curious why are

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you still sending everyone five emails a
day asking for more money
you won you have a gambling problem we
don't know about
did you put it on Gonzaga
you did didn't you he did President

name:Hasan Minhaj

in his second term sir you recently
appointed John Kerry and Chuck Hagel
very smart move you appointed the only
two people in the United States who look
even more tired than you

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:it's a great strategy mr. president
you're going to leave office is a very
young man and yet the presidency has
taken its toll I don't want to alarm you
sir but you're starting to look like a
judge on law and order just say you're

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:on thin ice counselor you could have
that part right away seriously mr.
president your hair is so white it could
be a member of your cabinet
he can handle it speaking the cabinet
the president recently picked his new

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:Treasury secretary Jack Lew gives me
great joy to know that if the president
ever has to let him go
he'll get to say it's not Lew it's me
but the court I hear the most about the
president is that he's always the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:coolest guy in the room that's what
everyone says he's the coolest guy in
the room all right but here's my
question who else is in that room it's
not hard to be the cool one when the
other guys in the room are Biden Hagel

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:and Kerry I'd be cool too if I was stuck
in a room where Tom Vilsack is showing
Steven Chu how to do the Harlem shake
now I've made some jokes about the
president this evening and I'm looking
forward to my audit it's coming I know

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:sir it's coming but I would like to take
a moment here and change gears and say
something to the president regarding the
events the past two weeks some of you
may not know this I grew up in Boston my
parents still live there and my brother

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:Luke raised his family in Watertown and
I'd like to take this opportunity to
thank you mr. president for visiting
that great city and helping its people
begin to heal with your inspiring new
words it made a huge difference

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:it's been said recently that you don't
mess with Boston as someone who grew up
there I'd like to echo that sentiment

going to pick on a city don't choose one
where 9 out of 10 people are related to

liberal democracy from college campuses

the President

it's assigned to the rest of the world
it's amazing tradition that shows the
entire world that even the president is
not beyond the reach of the First
Amendment but the president didn't show

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:up because Donald Trump doesn't care
about free speech the man who tweets
everything that enters his head refuses
to acknowledge the amendment that allows
him to do it think about it it's almost
sort of at 11:00 it's 11 p.m. right now

tweeting about how bad Nicki Minaj

to go over I can't get to everything I
know there's a lot of people that want

Trump campaign was in contact with
Russia when the Hillary campaign wasn't
even in contact with Michigan
of course Trump is in here if you
haven't noticed he's not here and I know

name:Hasan Minhaj

it turns out the President of the United
States is the one pussy you're not
allowed to grab
[Applause]
[Music]

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:now I know people really want me to go
after Trump tonight but I think we
should give the president credit when he
deserves it
like he pulled out of the Paris
agreement and I think you should get

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:credit for that cuz he said he was gonna
pull out and then he did and that's a
refreshing quality and a man
most men are like I forgot I'll get you
next time
well there's gonna be a next time when

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:people say romance is dead
people called Trump names all the time
and look I could call Trump a racist or
a misogynist or xenophobic or unstable
or incompetent or impotent but he's
heard all of those and he doesn't care

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:so tonight I'm gonna try to make fun of
the president in a new way in a way that
I think will really get them mr.
president I don't think you're very rich
like I mean you might be rich in Idaho
but in New York you're doing fine Trump

name:Hasan Minhaj

Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and things

borrow money from the Russians and now

name:Hasan Minhaj

blackmail and possibly responsible from
collapse of the Republic yay
it's a fun game Trump is racist though
he loves like nationalist which is a
weird term for a Nazi calling a Nazi a

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:white nationalist is like calling a
pedophile a kid friend
for Harvey Weinstein a ladies man which
isn't really fair and he also likes
plants tribes also an idea guy he's got
loads of ideas you gotta love him for

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:that he wants to give teachers guns and
I support that because then they can
sell them for things they need like
supplies for tractors a lot of people
want Trump to be impeached I do not
because just when you think Trump is

teeth and then drinks orange juice and
things mmm Mike Pence is also very anti

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:[Music]
morning everybody is DJ envy Angela Yee
Charlemagne the guy we are the breakfast
club he got a special guest in the
building
yeah yeah what's up me and a saw go back

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:- I'll go back the MTV oh my god
philosophy they was doing a whole
another ridiculousness yeah lots of feet
man it got cancelled I can't you knows
great though actually I met a lot of
like New York comedians out of that we

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:met it was fun the bright side of it is
I met a lot of great people yeah
temporarily I was living in LA and then
I moved out to New York for like a
couple months and then we you know was
my first time learning how to how to

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:host a show work with a panel it was a
really good experience I don't think it
was I I knew alright this could possibly
not go well I mean the title of the show
was fail off sofy it's like pretty bad
yeah somebody someone at MTV and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:ridiculousness was popping in he was
trying to yeah you know how when
something works then they're like we
just need Diet Pepsi that that was like
philosophy was like the designer to
future there you go

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you know house is like it sounds the
same but it's not the same like it was
kind of like that and in light of that
show told like watching how you grown
out that wasn't really you anyway no but
but it was a again it was you got to

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:perform you got to stand up there tell
jokes it's good prepped me for the Daily
Show
how much have this current political
climate helped your career you think
that's interesting I don't know you know

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:I think now political culture has become
popular culture and I could feel that
when I was at that when the Daily Show's
at the conventions the DNC in the RNC
when I saw enews and vh1 there I was
like okay like politics has become

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:reality television yeah
he has that professional wrestling
background he's brought that to politics
so I said that doesn't wonder because
the Kardashians look so wack to me now
ever since the Trump Trump's got into

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:the White House yeah I'd rather keep up
with the Trump's than the Kardashians
yeah because reality is stranger than
fiction yeah so that's a lot more crazy
than anything you could you know pre
write for it you know you know what I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:mean yeah but it's weird it's definitely
definitely bizarre what did you think
about the whole Bill Maher situation
with him using the n-word and then
people wanting to fire him and then some
people saying listen

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:Bill Maher as a friend to black people
it was wrong for him to do that but we
should let it slide but would be yours
yeah I think it's like this so first of
all being from the Muslim community
we've had problems with Bill Maher

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:before he's got a lot of sort of
Islamophobic rhetoric that he's you know
done on the show yeah so he's been doing
that and he's kind of gotten to pass
people are like no no he's a he's a
bastion of freedom of speech and he

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:gives it to politicians I think those
aren't mutually exclusive concepts he's
made a few bad decisions but he's also
groundbreaking and revolutionary in that
medium you don't I'm sayin so I can have
problems with one and still give props

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:in another in another way as well I
actually used the n-word in reference to
something that I was called do you know
what I mean I'm special I talk about
no but I don't use the word no yeah and
I've been I've been called the sand and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:word yeah yeah but I don't openly use it
now I don't I don't see a reason to yeah
there's so many other words you could
use like I've never understood that
debate why is that a thing where it's
like can I use it like what why I don't

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:I still don't understand the fundamental
reason as to why Muslims friends in
Puerto Rican friends well everybody uses
the word and it doesn't feel away cuz we
all like brown and black
well you beige but you know what I mean

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you're people of color right my thing is
are on the side of caution
even if someone gives me the past like
you can use it I'm like why you should
even yeah yeah what you a this onto your
favorite records but I'm also old enough

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:to like understand context so I'm just
like alright so for me it's just Paris
we're in Paris shoutouts to Google Maps
were in Paris you know oh you got to
think about the someone told me this and
I was like man knowing this and then

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:using the word kind of messes with my
head he's like there's no other word in
the English language that says hey I
used to own you like property Oh like
what other word has that connotation Oh
or I don't know man

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:so to me I can't speak um yeah so to me
using that word that's like I'm old I'm
31 I know now I'm old enough to know
like I don't know man you know in a
special I talk about a hate crime that
happen at my house post 9/11 when they

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:do the glass yeah and and the people
that were calling our house called me
and my dad a sand n you know but I I
made the choice to to use the word in
the special so that people could hear it
this is what people have called me a SAN

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:n a dune Coon a camel jockey say yeah
but - like what they're like saying
that sounds great I'd like alliteration
so dune Coon is funny yeah crime was
hilarious so you know they smashed in
the windows to our house but you're like

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:yo your alliteration game oh my god it's
poetic
yeah it'll go to these real deep moments
yeah and then you come out with yeah but
laughter and crying are two sides of the
same coin you've ever been in it like a

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:really fucked up situation and then
you're also like this kind of hilarious
all swollen and I was crying and then he
just turned the laughter yeah and the
first time I masturbated I laughed and
cried at the same time she's this man I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:did cuz the girl had broke my heart
I thought masturbation was a bad thing
so I was jacking off because I hadn't
had sex heard in a while cuz she was
messing with somebody else and I was
crying like look what you making me do

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:uh-huh
but those tears are good at that point
is that good lubricant shut up boy you
shake your hand all the time I do right
right but it's on Netflix is homecoming
king yes how do you feel when comedians

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:make Muslim jokes does that bother you
at all I'm about for me I'm really a
proponent of a free speech so to me I I
think what's great about freedom of
speeches is the open marketplace of
ideas so say what you want to say but

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:I'm a big advocate in presenting the
best argument may the best argument win
mm-hmm so you can get up there and you
can say whatever you want to say you
have the right to do that whether it's a
comedian or Richard Spencer you can do

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:that you're gonna face potential
repercussions there you go but my as a
comedian I'm like I'm gonna present a
better argument to the audience and I
would hope that the audience is like
yeah that guy's right not this insane

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:dude there's this great photograph and
I'll never forget it there's a
photograph of an african-american woman
a black woman protecting Klansmen who
are you know like doing a demonstration
she's protecting them from being hurt

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:she's saying hey she's protecting their
freedom of speech even though these
people are insane
let them do what they want to do because
I believe sanity will outweigh their
extreme rhetoric you shouldn't get in

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:the way of what God may have plan for
birthing because the Klan is putting out
negative energy move out the way sister
and let the negative energy hit them
where it needs it
oh we're in it we're interested in a

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:very interesting time man yeah do you
feel the pressure to be the mouthpiece
for Muslims guys I feel like you kind of
are in a strange way like it just
happened like that I mean we're having a
moment right now there's a lot of

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:different what I think is awesome is
we're getting a lot of different Muslim
voices out there there's Aziz there's
commandline Gianni there's Riz Ahmed so
there's something there's definitely
like a Brown Renaissance that's

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:happening which is cool I feel like
Muslims often talked about in the
country will rarely talk to at least in
the mainstream media that's why I
thought your stand-up was so good
because it was interesting just to hear

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:that
POV right you know oh what's crazies
we've been here for a long time I was
meeting about how they said the
depiction of Muslims in Hollywood is
non-existent or not very positive I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:think what's interesting yeah generally
not like if you look at like homeland
it's always from the perspective of okay
whether it was like serial podcast or
the night of or homeland it's like these
crazy brown dudes are radicalizing and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:they've come here to kill us what is
going on with these deranged young brown
kids and to me I would love to see a
narrative and that's what I wanted to do
in homecoming king is what is the 99.9
percent of Muslims what do they deal

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:with in the face of insanity right so
when a terrorist attack happens how do
they navigate the collateral damage of
that you know II spoke about that in
your special you spoke about how after
9/11 how America felt but then also how

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:Muslims and Muslim families yeah like
you know yeah I forgot what exactly the
wording you used but it was something
like how how afraid we are in the
country or for the country ISM well I
talked about this idea of the American

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:dream tax a lot of immigrants believe in
this concept where like my parents they
immigrated here they feel like if you
immigrate to the country you pay this
thing called the American Dream tax
you're gonna go through some racism and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:if it doesn't cost you your life
well you lucked out just pay the tax uh
I remember but I was born here so I'm a
citizen I actually have the audacity of
equality equal my dad's from that
generation like a lot of immigrants

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:where he feels like if you come to this
country
you're gonna endure some racism but for
me like a lot of us I was born here so I
actually had the audacity of equality
like I'm like no I'm in honors guv it

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:[Applause]
I like that phrase like I pay my taxes
I'm a I'm a contributing member of
society so that's the dichotomy that my
generation and my parents generation
they struggle with and I think a lot of

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:people even in the black community have
this we're behind closed doors believe
it or not a lot of minorities are
Republicans in the sheets and they're
Democrats in the streets they're
conservatives in the sheets and they're

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:liberals in the streets we're behind
closed doors are like hey it's not a
fair world so you got a you know be
prepared to deal with what you're gonna
deal with in the outside world then when
we're outside in the real world we're

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:like hey we're fighting for equality and
justice and all those things so I talk
about that dichotomy and the special a
lot I love that phrase audacity equality
because I feel like any oppressed and
marginalized group feels like that here

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:in America did you feel like that before
that situation happened to your father
or did you feel like that from from
birth I felt like post 9/11 I felt it
like okay now there's there's sort of a
target on our backs and I'm gonna have

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:to address this in some some way shape
or form and so right around you know I
started to think about that as I got
older you know now back to Bill Maher
real quick do you do you think he's
Islamophobic could that determine like

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:no no I think his his problem and you've
seen this in his documentaries he has a
problem with religion yeah totally
that's his thing where he's like hey do
you believe in God you're an idiot and
my problem with that is you know coming

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:from a minority background what's wrong
I think the majority of people are
secular religious people what I mean by
that is this they adhere to the laws of
the land they they want a separation of
church and state but in the privacy of

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:their own home they want to pray to God
and why are those two things like why is
that a bad thing but to lump every
person who believes in God or religion
and to call them an idiot or stupid
I think that's wack yeah I mean you know

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you know you brought him home Lynn and I
was thinking every movie that comes out
with somebody in it that's Muslim and
it's always I would say 90% of the time
is negative you know yeah and I was
thinking when we were growing up that's

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:how we looked in a lot of the movies if
it was a criminal it was always the
black guy absolutely there was a drug
dealer it was always the blasphemer yeah
yeah it seems like it just took time to
evolve and now we have better movies but

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:I don't see it coming as the are there
better movies down in the pipeline are
they offering you a chance
no no stuff is moving quick man okay
like master a nun there's a lot of cool
new narratives so I think what I what

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:I've noticed with art with black America
is this idea and I'm you know I think us
is brown artists we should take a page
from you know black artists you guys
have had to deal with this idea of
collective guilt you have to carry the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:burden of oh we should follow
Charlemagne around and in the store cuz
he's a he's gonna shoplift or he's gonna
you know what I mean
so you carrying that burden but now
there's narratives that show hey this is

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:what it's like to be a black nerd this
is what it's like to be a regular
everyday person who's living their life
and dealing with the repercussions of
negative stereotypes I do shoplift even
as a best seller cuz you know you pick

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:up in the store and you'll be reading it
like for whatever reason you can just
walk out with a magazine steal your
books no no a magazine
are you a klepto you know like people
have that like a compulsive stealing

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:thing I don't think so cuz I only do
magazines like that's the only thing you
have a lot to lose man oh really
have you no I think it's gotta be worth
more than you think it's a rational fear
of Muslims in America no I think that

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:the conversation that we need to have we
need to level up the conversation to say
blacks are the problem Mexicans are the
problem Muslims are the problem no it's
violent extremism so violent extremism
has no color or religion the dude who

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:just mowed through Times Square yeah or
the dude in Portland every community
every there are groups of insane people
in the world so combating that that's
the real conversation that we need don't
like extremist terrorists that the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:majority of people yeah the majority
people that Isis actually kills are
Muslims right that's the sad thing they
blow up mosques they're insane people
also this this this
irrational fear of Muslims in America

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:we're already here and we already
control every aspect of your life think
about New York City food transportation
medicine we have it all on lock you
leave this building
you're like Habib let me get a kebab all

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:right I'm so sick drive me to the
hospital
sure thing dr. Connell see you now at
every corner we could have gotten him
but we didn't so you're welcome my mom
is a doctor she's certain she um she

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:works at the VA she's been there for
decades at every corner she could have
poisoned you she didn't so you're
welcome
so we're contributing members of society
this is insanity to think that 1.5

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:billion Muslims want to destroy the
earth especially in the media all we got
to do is see one act or one case of
something a bola was itwas every block
everything down it's one person in
America would Ebola say anything with

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:Muslims back to terrorism happens we're
the new we're the new boogeyman but
we've always had a boogeyman don't you
think you'd be surprised
no he gruesome I mean yeah but a lot of
my black friends have known it for a

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:long time and that was part of the
article that I read that was saying that
the depiction in Hollywood of Muslim
people has been either largely absent or
negative and they also said a lot of
people in the United States have never

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:come across any Muslim people no they
have but they don't know again they're
like they don't know that their
pharmacist is Muslim their doctor is
Muslim because again the majority of
people are secular religious people man

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:I'm just your doctor I'm not trying to
bring religion into the conversation so
you don't realize that I want to like
extreme measures to change my last name
man I got it I gotta make it in
Hollywood but I don't never think about

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:stuff like that like I'm like black and
white is easier to digest you don't
realize all the shades of brown right
even yellow everything else does going
on in the world cuz everything in
America's soul black and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:we stopped it on the beach now what do
you think should be done about radical
Islamic extremist cuz like that you know
yeah but the Muslim bands and the ice
organization that surrounding people of
like what so what do you think we're on

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:the third travel ban there are more
travel bans than Star Wars reboots it's
insane it's like it's not even a hundred
fifty days one-third travel again yeah
people coming in from other places it's
people that were here yeah learn and I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:think a lot of this happens a lot of
recruiting happens online to correct how
do you how do you combat extremism I
don't know I'm not an expert again I'm
not the FBI has it affected you or your
family traveling or um I'm lucky because

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:my family is from India so that's not
one of the seven countries that was on
you know the ban so I'm very lucky in
that way but it's it's strange
especially coming out of the White House
Correspondents Dinner I took a lot of

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:heat from you know the alt-right and
that new movement of insane people on
Twitter yes I'm not like you because you
engage that's insanity
my dick you cracker-ass cracker yeah
that's insanity Charlamagne it's not

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:even ten o'clock yet like Charlemagne's
ready to go out Steve banning I'm like
what what am I gonna solve by going at
an egg avatar on Twitter sometimes I do
that but I don't engage either angel at
what point will be going at bald rape 97

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:how is that gonna be stupid white guy
hugging his girlfriend I mean I like to
sit on the sidelines and watch the
insanity unfold
Facebook's great for that too like
people you went to high school with just

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:slowly just going into absolute sheer
insanity I like to sit on the sidelines
I have Spike Lee tickets to just people
going nuts on the Internet
but but to think that I can I can at one
point have you argued with someone

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:online in their go they're like you're
right Charlemagne I'm sorry
season record is Owen 82 right so why do
you continue to get other people riled
up and get them to jump in and defend
him did you or something about something

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you say that's the news you engaged that
I thought he was gonna call me out after
the dinner yes cuz he's that crazy
I get why Donald Trump didn't want to be
roasted tonight by the looks of him he's
been roasting non-stop for the past 70

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:years I heard you had balls ready for
him I had some stuff I had I had I
called it um what was it called DEFCON
Orange
in case he showed up I had like an
orange card ready to go of like these

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:are all the jokes that I'm gonna do if
he shows up in the room because he
really is a professional wrestler so I
thought I'd be up there on the dais and
then the doors would burst open like
boom and he would just walk in I'm Doug

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:alright let's go yeah a man Richard
Spencer and Voldemort and all the Death
Eaters yeah like he would've been like
yeah like xpac like we're here like you
know that moment was so good for you
because nobody else wanted to do it yeah

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:and you stepped up Muslim comedian just
made perfect sense and I was like either
this is gonna go really well for the
song or really bad and you rose to the
occasion
what does Donald Trump tell Melania

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:listen babe last year on that bus with
Billy Bush that's exactly who I am yeah
that was a classic immigrant situation
nobody wanted to touch it who's the job
no one wanted to do I came in with my
bucket my mop and I'm like I give it to

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:the immigrant I t's here to solve the
problem and I just came right in and I
did what my dad and my mom and so many
other immigrants have done in this
country all right you guys don't want to
do this we'll do this and I'm gonna rip

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:it yeah you know what you know what's
interesting is like my thing is just
this is my personal position just try to
be tasteful that's all that's all you
know you can be critical my my thing has
always been like this be cutting you

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:don't gotta be cruel so I don't have to
hold a decapitated head of a president
to show that I dislike you can you
imagine you know who did it yeah oh my
god my career would have been over but
but I think think about think about the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:opposite when people are looking on Oh
Kathy Griffin's right imagine some
conservative comedian Jeff Foxworthy or
whatever holding up a decapitated head
of Barack Obama Elizabeth Warren Barack
Obama oh yeah we have been like this is

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:insanity so to me I'm like I'm all for
again an open marketplace of ideas may
the best idea win that was not a great
idea again you can be critical you just
you don't have to burn the entire
building down or go after Baron or you

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:don't have to do that don't have to be
shocking
correct correct and you can't threaten
the life of a sitting president you know
that's what it looked like look some of
the jokes that I had for the dinner

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:there what there were jokes like that
and I'm like no I'm not gonna make a
joke that's gonna imply you should
assassinate him I'm not like there's so
many other ways to go after somebody so
my thing is go up to their character

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:don't go after you know their life yeah
and it's worse for you because you're a
Muslim comedian but in the eyes of a lot
of people you represent all Muslims so
if you start making jokes about
assassinating the president it gets

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:taken out on a whole it gets
extrapolated and the whole thing yeah
collective guilt but everybody's dealing
with this idea of collective guilt now
do you think comedians have the license
to say or do anything we're lucky that

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:we in this country we do yes
you think so yes the fact that yeah the
fact that we're having this debate I
think is very very healthy India is one
of the largest democracies in the world
I couldn't stand up on stage and give it

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:to Modi it's impossible that can't
happen in India even though it's a
liberal and open free democracy so the
fact that we're having this discussion
figuring out all right where's the line
where do we go from here that's really

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:good man and it's a it is a luxury we
shouldn't take for granted have there
been any other backlash from the White
House correspondent then other than
online no what was cool is it's been
majority incredibly positive and I think

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:reaching out to journalists and saying
hey you guys are the new minority you
know like the way you guys are getting
it right now you're the scum of the
earth when one of you messes up he
blames the entire group I'm like yeah

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:welcome to our world
now you know what it feels like to be a
minority now like I think it engendered
empathy on both sides of the aisle you
haven't done the show down south yet
though

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:no I they sent me the Daily Show sent me
to Alabama I was like you know we have
white correspondents on the show right
you don't have to send me but it was
actually really good what's good did
they call you named I'm a when you go

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:know what was really cool as Trevor was
like no we need we're the one of the
lowest rated shows in Alabama so we had
this thing called Alabama week on The
Daily Show so but was awesome yeah but
it was cool because we covered every

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:topic religion guns the prison system
but you know you end up learning people
from the south and you probably feel
this way being from South Carolina
they're not a monolith absolutely
they're not just a bunch of toothless

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:hillbillies that does it doesn't work
like that there I learnt we learned that
there's a lot of people on both sides of
the aisle Democrat Republican they're
fighting for amazing good issues you
know and so that was really cool was

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:actually a great week I can't believe
that now covertly I'm sure I've
experienced yeah but I've never
experienced it overtly knowing you're
stand-up you talked about it yeah has it
been like overwhelming or would you say

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:when you were younger it was worse you
think it's worse now that's it's hard to
uh I will say this that feeling when you
turn on the news you know how sometimes
you turn on the news you go please don't
let it be a black guy please don't let

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:it be a black guy yeah we have that too
please don't let it be a brown guy
please don't let it be a brown guy cuz
we're gonna have to deal with the
repercussions of that so I feel that now
that I'm older you know my wife and I we

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:want to have kids and I think about that
I think about the world they live and
you everything about that with your kids
you have an amazing mentality I really
respect that where you're like I don't
look at my race or anything I think

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:about what I want to accomplish in life
and I actually have the audacity of
equality I deserve just as much as
anybody else and not only that I'm
unapologetically black and I believe in
my blackness and I believe that we are

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:great and we come from
long line of kings and queens and where
gods and what goddesses and we will
represent as such and that's great but
then also there's the pragmatic rubber
meeting the road of all right we have

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:the prison industrial complex we have
profiling for blacking we have stop and
frisk those are real things that you
have to deal with so for me I try to
swing between those two things well I'm
like I deserve just as much as any other

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:Y comedian and then I'm also like all
right these are the cognitive frameworks
of the world that we really have to
practically deal with so I try I swing
between both of them it's interesting
though because you know even you know my

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:book black privilege and I'm saying it's
a privilege and honor to be black and
people who come to me and be like oh but
what about mass incarceration and all
the oppression that I'd like to do it
I'm like those aren't our burdens to

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:bear those are things we have to deal
with but why are we victim blaming
like that's racists and bigots and other
people's prejudice that are causing
those things there's other people's
discrimination that are causing those

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:things all we're doing is just living
and being black so are you saying just
just you should be confident with
yourself and yeah yeah yes by your crush
yeah six I remember that was the first
time I remember why did he called you to

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:color put we are going back and forth we
should you know the sandbox oh six I was
like I love you by the way you shoes
like you're the culprit poop she doesn't
first time you know the first time you
experience racism you don't know what it

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:is when you see little kids and they're
playing with each other and then at some
point
socioeconomics a race becomes a thing
that's the first time I realized oh I'm
like I'm different you know that you

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:know what I mean like my last name is Yi
right my dad's Chinese it wasn't nobody
Chinese in my school nobody Chinese in
my neighborhood right so that was always
an issue for me growing up just having
that last name and everybody making fun

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:of me for that so how did you figure out
like I Det did you struggle with
identity stuff I wouldn't say that I did
just because my mom is black my dad's
Chinese and you know I mean it just was
making fun of me and then it actually

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:made me have a better sense of humor and
a tougher skin at a young
I knew karate wow it's actually made me
tougher how did you do with it cuz you
know you know what these kids these days
it's not tougher you know and my kids do

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:deal with it a lot now because they live
we live in a white neighborhood and
they're black and but I teach them to go
back at you damn right you crack up
not to say that I teach my kid no but
yeah but to be like hey you got to

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:either be good with your joke so you got
to be good with what dividing affect you
cuz once you let it affect you they win
that's true too yeah especially I was
like what like what was your color she
was trying to make a browns yeah you're

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:the color of food yeah and y'all were in
the sandbox it was a much better joke to
be had there but I mean for six that's a
good joke for a six-year-old for first
grader okay all right that's pretty good
man

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:she didn't smell like poop oh Jesus then
you talk about interracial relationships
a lot in this special right you think
that is what will ultimately help in
racism as time progresses I just I just
think that love intrinsically being

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:bigger than fear will help end it and in
seeing people as individuals that's the
thing that that to me will can be one of
the one of the many reasons that can end
racism if you stop lumping people as
these large monoliths and see people as

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:individuals and I know this is very
kumbaya but that's what helps I think
will help dispel the myth when you can
go hey Hassan is Muslim so if you like
him perhaps we can use this logic and
extrapolate it to 1.5 then maybe a

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:billion other people are normal and nice
and you know what I'm saying yeah that's
a lot there alright listen don't unpack
two things like it's the whole thing
about the I hate saying of goods
anything like oh he's a good white

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:person he's a good Muslim anything he
should be yeah yeah we should be judged
by the content of our character yeah
yeah yeah like it shouldn't be like when
you say it's a good Muslim of course
that means it's other bad Muslims but

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:it's kind of like saying all Muslims are
bad but this one is good look I think
the bottom line is can we get to a point
in our society where we're just seen for
our merits that's it that's a hard to
affects you in a negative way you always

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:look at whatever that was
yeah same way regardless sure if is if
if I had a bad incident with somebody I
don't know um come on we can let's say a
Puerto Rican is something to me you are
Porto Rican no I'm not Puerto Rican you

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:guys every time I look at something you
might look at them a certain way right
because it's not you you can't look at
people for their merit but it's it's
what happens is it's everything that
you've been do you know unfortunately it

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:I mean you've talked about this with the
car stuff right you have the story about
like when you go to the dealership you
get treated a certain way no no no but
but you're oh no I was gonna get into
that but that idea of just like you not

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:being judged based on your merit of like
who you yeah your DJ envy like of course
you can correct correct jeans and a
sweater hoody and I go into a dealership
that sells expensive cause I know yeah
sucks is like that you actually have to

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:care about the way your that's the one
of the shitty things like we actually
have to get dressed up and look good and
get your leg beard done to be like all
right this guy's normal whereas a white
dude can walk like Steve ban and can

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:walk into a dealership
what's flip-flops and sweatpants and be
like you don't know who he is he's the
co-founder of Google no like oh my god
Charlamagne it goes both ways cuz I grew
up where my father would always say

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:white people like dressed like white
people don't wear their money right but
then now I see somebody do that I was
like that dude could be Dylan roof you
know what I'm saying like I'm I got
prejudice - okay when it comes to this

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:certain thing I don't just look at a
white man to be like oh he's anything
sometimes these white dudes walk up and
I'm like hold up no man I've been into
department stores with my wife and if
we're not dressed the right way like if

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:we just go in bumming it yeah I've seen
you know I've seen the people who work
there treat other patrons better yeah
and that I have a problem with that
whereas if all right I'm putting on my
Daily Show suit and I look a certain way

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:then people like oh hey how are you sir
that that's what I'm talking about spend
your money there and support oh you mean
when I get you to like that a department
store yeah like I'll just take my
dollars elsewhere yeah I've been looking

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:at his face cuz I'm opening a restaurant
in Brooklyn and I went to go look one
day I don't like sweats
yeah and so the real
the was I'm showing the space shows up
he's like this is for you you're looking

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:for this like he didn't think that I
could potential I don't know if it's
because I'm a woman I don't know if it's
because of how I was dressed you can
afford it
I don't know nice wet suit I mean it's

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:still you know I love that you guys are
opening businesses that's so dope but
yeah a little taken aback by it I was
like yes I actually am looking for a
spot and then I was able to when we went
inside and looked at the space talk

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:about a lot of things and then he felt
more comfortable when I when he could
see that I knew what I was talking about
I just by looking at me he was looking
at me yeah that sucks you but the fact
that you have to like you have to beat

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:beat him by 20 points be like oh damn
he's got her shit together that that's
concerning like I don't like what about
this whole concept of phobias right like
when you talk about Islamophobia and
things like that I keep saying that I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:feel like people fear what they don't
understand correct
that's why I say again your stand-up
special is very good because I've never
had a conversation with a Muslim person
I can watch this and hear this POV at

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:the pole just getting fed thing correct
from the media correct you watch
homeland you're like these people are
terrifying if you watch say you know
homecoming king to me again I think it's
a representation of this is what 99.999%

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:of new brown America has to deal with
this is what it's like they turn on
their TV and they're dealing with
collective guilt and I wanted to put
that perspective out there I'm
empathetic to people that are being fed

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:a distorted version of reality I'm
empathetic to that you you can you only
make decisions based on what you know
but I think also you got to hold people
accountable to say hey you also have to
be open to new information

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:sure if you watch mainstream media you
were constantly being pedalled hey
you're gonna get killed from terrorism
tomorrow when statistically that's just
not true you're more likely to die
texting or crossing the street or you

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:know getting hit by a car like you're
more likely to die texting about Isis
than actually dying from Isis that's why
I love what you said about is 1.5 what
billion yeah and you could poison it
every day yeah

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:like almost a nearly a third of the
earth and I always talk about that book
I read the girl who escaped from Isis
right he talks about being in Syria and
being terrified of these Isis extremists
sure and how they ripped her family

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:apart and then she was you know taking
in and she was raped as a young girl and
all her friends and it is horrifying and
she kept me in like I wished somebody
from the United States would come and
save us Wow it's like they're victims of

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:that yeah and it's worse than we can
even imagine sure sure and get backlash
from other Muslims saying things like
he's not representing us representing us
right cuz I always see that with like do
you get that Emmy you've gotten that

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:right but - no always but to me again
it's like we're not a monolith we should
have different diverse voices within the
community this idea that one person has
to carry the mantle for everybody is
insane I agree

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:there's shades of belief and I think
that's awesome
I think that's awesome that you exist
here and there's other black voices that
represent other you know ideologies and
perspectives that's dope that's healthy

name:Hasan Minhaj

figure out and the smarter you are the
more you believe you believe so much

kids last name Patel moved that summer
and everybody was like what and then I
was an American now because there was
more immigrants not me I was like this
is cool until I realized wait a minute

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:these are my people because they were
the only other hustlers they wanted to
make money like oh my all my friends in
middle school were Indian kids because
they also wanted to shovel snow and wash
cars and make money yeah but to your

loser for getting these nips yeah the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:fucking suck yeah then there's just like
hey man complex contouring that now that
being said you're right but I think a
common thing that we talk about is I
sort of hit my stride em across a it's
like oh I can't get into is that scary

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:or was that like were you cool with that
I realized I think my freshman or
sophomore year of college when I started
doing stand-up was that I can't play
someone else's race uh right yes and so
there's a lot of immigrants that watch

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you and watch this stuff and I think if
you have ten desi kids all ten of them
aren't designed to be doctors that's
right and yet they're forced to and one
of my really good buddies is you
he dropped his gem on me he's like how

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:many future roomies have we lost to
become electrical engineers a hundred
percent right and so for me do you know
what my fear is right now it's going the
other way
yeah and I've friends tell me I want to

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:just take this because there's some of
you out there right now some of you
should go work at Bain & McKenzie and
Goldman and we'll crush it right but you
think it's this became cool and you're
gonna go want to start right we're of

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:dry-cleaning right and you're gonna
fucking fail and it's right and so you
know it's just self awareness yeah so
for me I was like I can play the game
everybody else is playing right and I
can go to the Caribbean and do med

name:Hasan Minhaj

tchotchkes and and pogs and stuff like
that right I realize I can flip jokes so
if I build a five-minute set and you I
could do Conan and then I could take
that Conan right at that point

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:ya know but to me I'm comedians
musicians
I'm so improv right like when I think
about hip-hop I'm always I always ask
boy I'm like who just spits it from the
dome Bruce who writes right right

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:because I'm always like oh I'm like the
spitters but no no you know you're like
a comedian that works it out on stage
yes so you'll do your set and he'll do
his same opener that he does at every
single TEDx I'm standing there

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:ten years old didn't like that he has
his beats right and it sharpens over
time hundred percent so he's a guy who
works at on snooze wait a minute now I'm
me who is that historically in comedy he
was a Chappell Chappell great and he's

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:the one he doesn't still he was
consistent work onstage comedian like
Marc Maron okay uh chappal what about
Aldo Dave Doug was Richard Pryor I don't
know nothing about I've got it but Rock
is very rope yeah I know he's like

yeah analyze myself on stage business
keynote yeah I literally have that
cadence right like the the delivery of
my point right okay when people talk to
me about the comedy thing I'm like that

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:makes so much sense right I listened to
so much of it as a kid yeah the only
difference between what you do and what
we have to do is stand up says or shit
has to be airtight yeah very much there
can't be lulls in between so you know

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:how like when you're ranting up
sometimes people and there's just it's
yeah yeah yes that's but that's the
beauty and that's the the struggle and
what I love about comedy yeah is that
from minute 0 : 0 0 to 60

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:it's gotta be tired it's cool so do you
go in the bunk like some of the
characters like when you get ready for
like when you did your special yeah how
do the special go that you knew he was
coming do you go into like the cocoon

name:Hasan Minhaj

I had a really powerful you know to me
homecoming king was kind of like a brown
John Hughes movie I had a great story to
tell my life growing up just like you

counter yeah I only prefer when I'm
going into rooms where people think

favorite spot yes because the market you

about to type it again but I don't know

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:who my heart is pumping at 150 dates per
minute how do you know that do you have
some sort of device on you right now I
don't know I I can't figure it out I
don't know it's different today or and
I'm just seeing a call from Gary d6 is

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:the other question oh yeah I have a
question you know you know both of you
right now we know the combination is
like the legend tool and speaking at the
time act very smart unlike comedy where
there's no down you know yes on already

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:told us no like downside or like no you
gotta be tight person yeah there's a lot
of laws going on right now addiction
Dixit where are we run stop we're very
into laws we want long awkward pauses
to build up suspense so you take your

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:time fire away with your question oh
yeah the thing is I'm an aspiring
comedian I'm ready now and said right
now and that's the question to happen
and I just need an advice because you
know someday fire down the line down the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:line I want my own Netflix you know
filling stadiums and stadium on tour
so that's a you wanna you want Netflix
as best you want Stadium tours like
Kevin Hart shit right crazy yeah and
again my question for you you know I've

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:been associated with this you know best
network marketing company in the world
and I want to be a food for the
financial freedom in the next five years
later on 24 I want to be financially
free by 30 I don't wanna work for the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:rest of my life the sounds gonna answer
your other question I'm gonna tell you
do not make up arbitrary numbers of
financial freedom the quickest way to
not be financially free by 30 is by
deciding right now that you want to be

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:financially free by 30 okay what you
need to do is look every day as a day of
like like fix it don't buy a dumb coffee
for four dollars and 13 cents tomorrow
understood
yeah good okay huh yeah you so you're

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:quite you want a Netflix special you
want to do stadiums alright so I think
the bottom line is you wanting to be
financially free by thirties do a lot
easier than look man how many people do
stadiums at this point Kevin Hart 2 3

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:yeah right yes so far 3 it's time do you
understand that you're asking for
obnoxiousness by doing stadium know you
can you can watch you got to be that
good but yeah I don't think it's
impossible yeah I do think it's so yeah

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:man you gotta you gotta get up on stage
as much as possible you have to be the
best in your city state country you got
to be one of the best comedians in the
world so you got to devote your life to

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you kind of like bullshitting and
calling in random fucking podcast
calling in shows no man I'm doing what I
can to sound know what I'm talking about
we just already talked about some reason
I'm kind of by Calton cuz I wanted to

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:ask y'all something cuz this ain't about
me I called about y'all cuz I'm very
inspired by man that's cool listen so
like for example like well my question
though for real bro is you know music
and comedy ever went hand-in-hand right

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:and I'm like Chappelle has been very
successful at that integration and stuff
like that yes like how do you guys feel
about like the intersection between
comedy and music and like do you think
we should start seeing more tours and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:shows like from both sides of the corner
I know the guys before the stuff you
know like doing stadiums in you know as
a comedian it's like it's like you know
it's like very few and far between but I
don't know I feel like if you were

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:taking music and comedy and doing this
one quick thing okay so go go if you do
a tour with dixit i will go to every
show in every city so alright so this is
my take on it I think that musicians and
comedians are very like simpatico in

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:terms of the way we think the way we
work the way we operate in the way we
write and produce stuff that being said
music shows and comedy shows have to be
set up very differently like mindset of
the end consumer it's just a mindset of

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:the the audience like I've been asked to
perform to open up before a hip-hop show
and I'm like I'm not gonna do that
because peep you'll come out there and
people like bring nas out I don't want
to see you talk about politics and so

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:like to me out the only person who's
executed that flawlessly and this is
just a testament to how great he is as a
comedian is Chappell Chappell is such a
savant at having a comedy audience go to
music not the other way around so a

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:comedy event is already low-key and
they're in a good sort of mellow vibe to
then go all right chance the rappers
coming out all right Lauryn Hill's
coming out okay Lil Wayne's coming out
you can you can go you can ramp up you

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:cannot take a hip hop show and ramp it
down to my musings on political America
that that's just what it is but but like
you've been clearly going home right you
two are going on tour that's real right
Romy and anique yeah no we got it but we

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:got to collab on something I think I
just think that like the way we vibe
creatively is a is a thing where the two
could I actually think a place where
comedians and musicians can do you think
and coexist thinkin eek is gonna get

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:real big I think he has the potential to
be as big as he wants to be anique dude
do you think you're gonna get really big
I think I have the potential to be as
big as I wanted yeah that's what it is I
think

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:man like like like yo we're super
pragmatic as they see it's you got to
just maximize your talent I love it how
much do you have in your ACL you know
what I mean like I can use a new John
yep just put it to LSU B that's I think

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:one thing I think one thing that
sponsors about that I really really
agree with is the fact that as
foreigners of immigrants like we just
gotta we just gotta be five times red
that everything you just we just have to

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:just become just me that shit has to be
like insanely awesome just to be
compared that's a good or way honestly
I'm gonna jump in here on this one I
think that's real issue I think it's the
right right and set to have yes I think

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:it's the right mindset to have but I
think the market is the market is the
market so yeah I what I love about what
both of you do is there are gatekeepers
in 1982 right then I got fuck these
brown guys I'm not I'm gonna put them on

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:right all right you went to fucking
YouTube right right at least I want him
to fucking put out music is Spotify
doesn't give a fuck if you're white and
fat from Oklahoma or you know some guy
from like it's um it's an amazing time

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:to be alive yeah yeah V yeah yeah that's
just reading right oh you know what we
need to do if you're around at 11:00 you
need to come to a comedy show and then
Annie comes to come out and then we'll
the fact that you oh you're going to

of it you don't I mean drive its it you

name:Hasan Minhaj

name:Hasan Minhaj

going forward
oh I'll tell you second who's this sit

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:down sit down
yeah yeah yeah this is Gary Vaynerchuk
you're on the askgaryvee show
oh it's real amazing
do you have a question for Hassan or me
the questions for you okay so hi son

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:yeah yeah hey we've actually met like a
few years ago that's this oh no no one I
need the story how did it go what's this
on meaning person that is super cool I
was at electorate daily show and I met
him later on after the show did you guys

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:take a picture was a quick thing because
he was running to something or had to go
down yeah no he had another show that
night headed out well you think about
maybe like cuz you like them so much to
maybe go to that show and support him or

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:were you like selfish and just went home
and did nothing no I had to fly back I'm
asking that from New York
but I was absolutely gonna be there I'll
stir it down good story okay question
cool yeah yeah so for me Gary I look I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:love all your shit but I'm not you know
trying to be an entrepreneur I just want
to have that hustlers mentality okay so
when you talk about trying to be the the
number 16 at Facebook or you know number
2 at this company how do you go about

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:doing that and how do you reverse
engineer that goal so are you talking
about catching the tiger by the tail
like finding a sucks or Osaka or Marc
Benioff or is that where you're going
yeah yeah for me I mean that big goal is

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:to be like the one of the top digital
minds and a top company understood so a
couple hacks number one I'm a big fan of
somebody that's done it before right so
there's a lot of so like when Ilan is
like I'm gonna do Tesla that was

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:probably a good idea to figure out what
if anything you could have brought in
value to that person in that company
because Elon through PayPal and other
things showed you that he had that oh
look who's here

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:hey the man the myth the legend Audie
rocks so III think that look I think
that I loved it and I think that uh I
think that I would be high and I mean
really high on looking at somebody who's
doing another

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:rodeo after a successful one I'm a big
fan number two do you have the same
beliefs that I have around voice if you
do finding founders that are building on
top of Alexa or Google home because you
believed so much in the thesis Alexa

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:stop do you know so much of the thesis
of that so I think that's important so I
think there's a couple ways number one
somebody who's done it before doing
something new you think they're a ninja
even though they built a great food

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:company even though they're starting a
t-shirt company they've been there
they've done that and people are netting
against them and you jump on that number
two you believe in a trend so much
cryptocurrency voice something else that

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you jump on that number three just
intuition that you were mesmerized by an
individual and even though they're
talking about selling you know cricket
protein snacks in 2022 you just believe
mm-hmm and once I find that it's you

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:know you're talking about trying to get
in touch with them and working my item
or just follow them know following them
for what no I think you need to follow
them and figure them out and know it how
they tick and what they need and then

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:figure out if you can provide that and
then pound them with the narrative that
you can provide that like like DM Karen
and be like hey I'm a digital marketer
your protein shake made out of crickets
is phenomenal I will blow up your

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:snapchat and I'm great with Pinterest
pin fluent sirs and I'm great on you
Tunes right yeah so like know your skill
and by the way your skill might just be
that you're a hustler and you have great
work ethic like a lot of the people in

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:this room right now
I picked on to hustle and work ethic or
they hacked it and created a viral video
on reddit that got my attention then we
interviewed and there's been other
people that have gotten my attention

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:through hacking and put you said it put
out content like he put out content
videos great right so like you know that
worked but I've had other people I've
met after they've hacked and it the
interview didn't go well like there's a

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:million different versions I think
tenacity and really trying to understand
what that person needs at that moment
the amount of people that have gone on
to build empires after being in the mail
room or bringing coffee for three years

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:is a remarkably high they had the
humility to be studio mattress food
because they knew what they were up to
got it so it I love where you're going
with this
you're already head of the game that

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you've sniffed out self-awareness that
I'm not a one I'm so happy that you've
taken a hold of my thesis of being
number four sixteen these are real
things there are so many people that
have done so much happiness for them and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:their families on being right about this
thesis now you've got to do two things
one be right which is hard but I gave
you three ways to look at it number two
you have tenacity to get in yeah and
yeah and that doesn't mean spamming the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:person the amount of people that are in
my inbox Tyler you know this email
number 97 that's not gonna work
if the first 96 didn't work we're
deleting you how do you have value
you're not gonna sheer will your way in

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:just like I'm gonna spam you to that
right right yes so with that with that
balance I guess geez do you is your goal
to kind of take the time to figure them
out Uli's do the kind of grunt work and
then hit them a few times or should I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:try to kind of push myself person is
different there's a lot of people that
are completely turned like a.j my
brother who's a winner is turned off by
the things that I'm turned on with like
I like tenacity so you have to beast you

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:have to know the person you have to know
them now that's why I get pounded so
much because I say that I like it but
the truth is only one is gonna get
through the ten thousand fifteen
thousand so you have to be thoughtful

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:another thing I would recommend for
example let's say you wanted to hack us
on and I just wanted to work for free
because you wanted to be a comedian and
you love his Jam right well he has the
next special coming out in that month or

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:two moving up to it he's on because he
wants it to be successful that's exactly
when he may need something I have a book
coming out January thirtieth right
preorder it now yeah I am gonna want it
to be successful this is an awfully good

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:time to hack me or or if I can impress
the people around him oh these guys are
100 percent he doesn't watch stranger
things but if they do they're like
you heard of stranger things he's like I
got those weird kids no but like hitting

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:I'm very there you're chief of Santa
right so you can get to their chief of
staff I do that's right hey here's the
pitch but not d-roc his filters terrible
he's been wrong pro system but everybody
else yeah yeah I already followed Pilar

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:and Babbitt and d-roc and you're on your
way all right
I don't know why Dark Horse's babban you
go to Babbitt man Meaghan go to heaven
some we need to be friends let's do it I
really I'm ready and available you

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:really think it all depends on how about
you but you do intuitively feel it what
do you like
no no 30 sets just a bad that I don't
like the question okay good I'm gonna
ask it again okay do you intuitively

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:feel I mean do you I mean this I believe
in myself but I know there's variables
outside of my control
yeah yeah so that's it do you believe if
the variables that are outside your
control do not happen the death of your

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:wife can't sir like real shit right do
you become pretend it is of course yeah
right yeah do you believe then it is a
foregone conclusion yes because it's a
game on my mind cool so if I stay with
it as long as you know Dick Gregory and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:that right yeah yeah yeah yeah I really
you know I'm fat what do you think that
is I'm serious for now I want to have
this conversation but the thing I don't
like about that question good here's
what I don't fundamentally don't like

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:about that question is all of these
things are predicated on when I get the
Netflix special when I do this no no you
get to do comedy the set I get to do
tonight at 7:20 p.m. is the win dude I'm
not an engineer

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:I'm not a doc I won period I guess it
being predicated on you you're gonna be
really huge you're gonna be bigger than
X yeah no no yeah to me it's just been
about the work you're in house money
full time full time as long as vena and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:my family were good then we're good
I totally get a man so yeah so like to
me putting it on those things I want to
maximize my I understand so that the
challenges are can I turn around my next
I said if within three years can I do it

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:within a year and a half and have it be
as good get it
that's stuff
I don't want to own the Jets I want to
try to yeah there you go I get it yeah I
get it

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:so much yeah but I would lie if I didn't
say it feels weird to know how this is
gonna play out outside of a fork like a
real tragedy I'm fascinated by that I am
NOT I'm not unaware like I'd be full of
shit right I didn't say holy fuck dude

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:I'm literally gonna be much bigger than
Oprah like I just know that truth right
right but I also know tomorrow I could
get hit by bus hello or me rock it loses
beating right now and it could make me
very upset I never recover yes hello

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:who's this show B oh wow yes this is

intriguing to you as much to me that

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:it's the Miami Heat LeBron James are you
from Miami was that a special moment no
I do not change your facebook cover in
seven years tell the truth
that's my role model hi what is as soon
as you want to do Miami I've been there

name:Hasan Minhaj

favorite athlete of all time so it's
inspiration so where do you leave it on
there I live in Houston Texas you need

him I want this onto forever listen to
that voicemail I'm actually curious what

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:quick cuz I'm just curious why you
didn't pick up but let's go back to who
was that again yeah we gotta go back to
you were disappointing news LeBron I
knew what the Cavs go there I knew you
were optimistic you were so you know

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:what I love you for wanting it to be the
the rocket yeah I knew it was the
fucking case you knew it too
you know you feel better now we decided
to knock you got a pick and stick you
can't be like I know a lot of guys like

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you know the bandwagon dubs fans like
you got to not do that
show me do you follow that you use
LeBron James to instill some self esteem
like this is my big thesis I believe a
lot of kids in America the patron take a

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:Patriots warrior fans
oh my because they need to feel that
winning mentality do you feel when you
were young as all of us with the
insecurities you gravitated towards the
easy win of the Miami Heat

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:uh well not 100% because when we lost
against Dallas I still have a bronze
best knock and I do do that I used to be
it's not we you damn it okay but
everyone hate on LeBron and I did not
care what you were you born Olajuwon

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:shit on him right at Pippen and Berkeley
came over this shit by the time you're
seven seven years old you can watch Gary
come on to get worse you were a Houston
fan when Pip and Barkley were there
until you realized how much of a loser

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:Pippen is right no I was a little Sean
Kent by that time I was I was in Seattle
I was that Thunder fan you needed to
dust animoves
I can't
I don't know what's happening I cared I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:don't know what's happening this time
more than anything guns 23 people people
as your ancestry - no no no sure this is
a way he's right
no listen are you listening to this he
said people what you're saying how do

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you pronounce your name cuz I want to
get it right so my nickname is show V
show B thank you show B what you were
saying to us on is people rooted for
Jordan and the Bulls but they weren't
from Chicago correct exactly - show me

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:show me here just real quick and Hassan
says he knows everything which by the
way I'm so fuckin flattered I just want
to say it on the record I am so
flattered by how much you know about my
stuff thank you I mean it okay

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:the only people that rooted for Jordan
outside of Chicago are fuckin losers oh
man yeah help you fucking losers let me
tell you why shobun you'll love this cuz
you're a winner and we're gonna make you
a rockets fan tonight listen to me

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:here's why if you need to root for a
team outside of your own city because
they're winning subsidizes your lack of
winning you by definition are a loser
I can't I mean I'm going the you see
James Horton performance against San

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:Antonio he is a he's a regular season
offensive like beast but when it comes
to the playoffs he disappeared I I don't
believe in God you understand your bro
most of my relatives and best friends
are massively flawed but they're fucking

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:mine oh shit that's some immigrant shit
right the end nah they don't get a Gary
come on I know that my thing is pick and
stick he was a man I know and that's the
flaw suit this is getting better this is
fun mph at

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:I've never liked it more wait you were
never a Seattle fan you were born in
Seattle you mentioned Shawn Kemp I wish
you mentioned Gary Payne one of the few
athletes that shares my name but what
didn't you do when you were first a kid

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:I mean my brother growing up he was a
huge fan he was riding with Jordans oh
well stop with that for a minute what's
up with that for a minute
your entire thesis of opening this show
is right he has none of his own ideas

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:his brother set the tone so I'm glad we
established that from earlier in the
show you're going brother your brother
who clearly shares your DNA cuz he lived
in Seattle but he rooted for Jordan
correct but I'm not saying Jordan is the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:best I feel it runs eventually that guy
that praises I'm that guy that gives
Jordan who's LeBron as my favorite I
pick him that day he's better than
Jordan but personally the bronze my
favorite athlete I pick him over Jordan

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:as a personal favorite just cuz I like
the guy he he carries his team he knows
the other way and I'm a LeBron fan
you're a LeBron fan and a Rockets fan
though if they played in the finals
you picked the Cavs over the Rockets

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:right I have to keep the bronze legacy
going to do that Shelby what's your
question
alright to the question so so it's all
based off of the conversation we have
already I'm just gonna try to guess

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:three or four as possible so you're
probably gonna say the same thing cuz
it's like I'm kind of like all over the
place but pretty much I love I love
making films like that's been my passion
since I was very young

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:okay and I kind of carried that on I was
acting a lot in it before and now I'm
actually producing short free own
sketches stuff of different short I'm
doing like Pakistani Indian continent
I'm also doing American content so I can

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:kind of get both of the crowd and I know
a lot of actors here so a lot of
resources come easy to me in order to
cast them and then use them so I've been
Huston for a long time I've been
literally soldiers so I've built that

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:type of network now with all those
concepts I'm creating it comes with a
cost and whenever I'm doing type of
production I'm the one that's working
out the money I'm trying to keep it as
as cost-effective as possible play you

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:know I just can't control that sometimes
but I try my best so with that being
said that's my main passion I'd love
doing that but now when it comes to like
I'm 28 right so in a-flat
there too because you can kind of relate

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:i've Pakistani parents there on my case
about getting married like every single
day my entire family is right so they're
pushing me there I'll just be mad with
my my filmmaking stuff which is all good
and I understand and I'm a marketing

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:advertising major right so I started I
just started a marketing company I'm
working off gearing enough so I have two
videographers the photographer I have a
you know social media person so that
business is going slow because I'm the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:only sales guy so I'm like I'm so with
my films I direct I write them I I
thought like I I act on them I produce I
do everything a cast and then all my
business side is I'm the one that's
doing all the fields called following up

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:doing that admin work so I'm wearing all
the hats there's nobody else there's
only me doing all that work so I do
stuff for businesses to make a little
bit of money and then I do my passionate
stuff now with my business stuff it's

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:not sparking up like as fast as I wanted
to just because you know how this game
goes so and and I can be the first to
admit I never had the best to work at
this growing up and and that's why I
love Gary got a love of my just likes I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:listen you're my top guy so like you're
telling me you're being straight up on
all your post about don't care what
people think
crying come back and grind and I'm
trying to do that but honestly I gave

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:burned out and I'm just like dude I'm
going to do my film I have all these
crazy ideas when I'm driving I'm
listening to music but then I got to
make money somehow and then so I just
picked up with part-time sales you're

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:out tsunami
that's another addition that what I'm
doing so just like I'm just I'm sweating
my stuff a little too thin but do ideas
everything I put out everyone likes I'm
being real I recognition so when people

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:see me randomly come up to me it's like
hey here's that guy in the video and I
get a picture like they're all telling
me like I love your stuff so I know it's
going well and I believe in my stuff but
it's just too much that I'm doing it I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:mean I mean I'm still learning about
this since I never owned the business
I've never knew things about the
business I'm like a student to that but
the quality is stuff I'm doing for the
businesses appreciate it so I'm doing

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:good there too so I'm just kind of like
got like what do I do and I'm getting
older I'm like man I just I need to I
need to grasp something but I don't I
don't like I can't just I can't I don't
know let me get this straight so your

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:just you're just living life right like
you're living like first of all the fact
that you took zero breaths in that rant
destroyed like he's unbelievably funny
mom like weirdly like oh shit I want to
be funny too now cuz I'm hanging with

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:him you just destroyed it what was the
question the question is easy I
understand the question there was no no
no the question is the question no don't
worry I heard the question because I get
that question every day it's no no no

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:it's you got to talk for nine and a half
hours hold on one second I his question
was quite simple actually I have my
voice and then there's all the outside
voices how do i balance right and you
know this and we've all been through it

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:in one version couple things the reality
is is this there was a couple themes in
there that excited me hey I have a very
big thesis that if you are a Jordan and
LeBron fan you also highly are likely to
be lazy which you admitted in there

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:which excites the shit out of me and I
think it's an interesting insight show
Ben I'm being serious with you I think
what's super interesting about what you
were talking about is you don't love the
process I'm about to fuck with

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:everybody's heads really quick here the
reason I love people who stick with
their towns teams is the journey to
finally get good is so much more
intoxicating than being good I'm not
joking this may sound funny I'm really

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:trying to help you show because I want
you to win I think you need to fall in
love with the process of the grind
versus the anxiousness of getting there
like the celebrating is not the fun part
the process of getting there is and so

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:when I look at your narrative that you
just went through you're you're trying
to you you want the good stuff that
comes along with it you like the selfie
that you take in Houston once in a while
because they saw the video and you're a

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:local celebrity right but the reality is
is you've got to fall in love with the
shit the the people who never get lazy
sometimes are obsessed with the process
of
they're up to I have never ever gotten

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:lazy sometimes because I've been
addicted to everything I've done post
school I got lazy all the time in school
cuz I hated it I think you need to look
into the insight I think you need to
deploy triple humility like are you are

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you trying why are you not going all-in
on film
is it because you live at home no I have
a apartment which wasn't the best
decision like I mean I do have a farm
you know I'm moving back home but but

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:moving out moving out with great I mean
I mean dick you've spent money that
meant nothing and you could have used
that money to not do side jobs and keep
crushing your craft right like it was
super great to have that party when

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:everybody came over it was pumped to
have a spot to have your girl over in
but it wasn't great in the macro that's
driving your life your youngest shit you
feel old at 28 I'd ripped my fuckin leg
off to be 28

text:you didn't think you're gonna call in

Indian excited right if you are you

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:decisions you know this is children of
immigrants we have two major decisions

ie who you marry that's a big deal in
our community and what you do so there

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:was a quick those are your bros
different than white Sally I'm asking
I'm asking because at 18 the majority of
my American friends yes you're free to
do whatever you're literally forced to
move out of the house so those two areas

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:indoors I understand okay I understand
we are property of our fathers I am
property of Nadja me manage you don't
mean it was a big fight to be right this
is who I'm marrying and this
what I'm choosing to do it was a fight

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:because immigrant parents are like no no
II I own you
fuck you talking about your choosing I
own you let you do what I want
I totally this is my thing though your
two big battles are those two battles

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:don't worry about the money
don't worry about all that stuff you
have to do those two things on your own
terms and you got an air mattress it if
you really love it
otherwise you're a fair-weather film fan

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:that's the way it's gonna or or actually
by the way or it might be like that
wasn't your destiny that what you it
wasn't really what you wanted to do
anyways but don't get into some risks
that you don't want to do and don't

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:oh yeah nurses like it yeah I got it and
don't don't um pursue engineering or
whatever because they're forcing you to
make all those decisions on your own
terms

post game for a little while now like
you you stressed the fuck out of your
parents quite a bit already right well I

look I mean it might be a stupid

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:decision but like like one of the
reasons I had I wanted to move out and
was if I it was a favorite of my parents
I her decision like I just had to do it
because I'm like the pressure inside the
house was like you have a marking memory

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:I have someone that's telling you can
get a 50k job so like it was just it was
just too much like I mean I mean my
parents are my parents you know my mom's

you're famous you know what the best way
to solve disappointment is what is the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:success right like I've already think
that yes so like but here's the funny
part you're in the first quarter and you
think the game's over
yeah you're alive like like a brother
you can literally win at 42 and then be

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:like
you like like like like you know like do
not like and do not let the pressure of
the 28th of funny year to me
27:28 like I'm reading a lot of content
this 28 27 29 like and 30 33 like this

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:kind of interesting age group where like
people make this funny switch when they
turn 27 and think they're old when
they're obnoxiously young right
fastening 101 that comes from sure so at
18 you leave you have independence from

like what am i doing
yeah I get it no no so write this some
that I planted have they manifested them

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:I get it
this is my advice for artists the thing
with artists is you do this the rest of
your life 100% that's the crazy part
like did my degree was doing comedy
until he died

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:yep in his 80s that's right that's the
game same with filmmakers same old
entrepreneurs yeah it's why I feel bad
for athletes right I used to think it
was the best right like James Harden's
gonna be done at 36 forever

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:he was many I mean that stuff like I
even like you know those the whole Oprah
and KFC and like the whole story of how
they've made it later on which is always
cool firing for like so a packet any
appearance it's like so to think your

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:cousin's younger than your husband are
324 getting married and you want to do
this and it's like and it's like no
everything important is hard I like you
think it was fun for me like I like it
was not fun for me every time my parents

name:Hasan Minhaj

the same game just a different skin tone
I feel like I get it but the reality is
is like fuck you dad like that's real
now I highly recommend you say dad I
love you with all my heart and I know

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:for a fact everything coming out of your
mouth is what you want for me and it's
how you see it but pops you did your
shit let me do mine let's post game this
in 30 years then we can judge I just
think it's silly to judge in the first

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:little operative part of that last part
your sentence I'll see you in 30 years
dude every family wedding everything by
the way I love that shame on the other
side I know you are not Simba left Pride
Rock listen I sing look I look for a lot

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:of people oh I get it
it's I'm just trying to give him and
more importantly every not more
importantly everybody like cool like
honestly you either go to you either go
to the wedding and grandma and and grant

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:aunt and great-aunt are shitting on you
yeah and you either hear that and say I
can't wait to stick it down your fucking
throat in 2029 or you say woe is me this
blows I like the first one and I think
it's an interesting debate of how

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:they're actually the same
yeah and how you train yourself to think
is an interesting thing that's all
you're a competitive person you like it
yes yeah I think that's fair it's a yeah
but you know what I've been fascinated

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:by how much we underestimate the brain
and how much we underestimate humans
I think of ton as DNA but I'm listening
I'm like by the way I'm a huge DNA guy
however I've been impressed now that I'm
42 why was blind DNA at 29 at 42 I'm

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:like huh the people you surround
yourself with like there's a lot of
variable you know like I got a Maximizer
yeah I become super fascinated by the
inner circle your chief of staff if he
keeps hanging out with fucking LeBron

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:fans in Houston he's gonna fucking lose
guess who I'm a fan who I love you can
stick I know dude they have you animate
you're 32 yeah man we had some good
years thousands Weber white shot live
we were robbed yes do you understand I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:do I do
we should do first
go buy a Houston Rockets Jersey it will
remind you of this conversation and will
change if you become a rockets fan when
we hang up it will change the outcome of

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:your life I don't entirely for sure for
sure I mean the family's not even like
it's not like I have the strictest
family in the world it is but sure
they'll change things I really believe
about the elephant the elephant in the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:room is easy when you're running or cp3
sure it is yeah it's okay because when
you with like hundreds everybody's a
Muhammad Ali hoodie yes like there's
there's a lot of interesting things to
this like look I think you're taking the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:black and white of it but if he actually
became a rockets fan right I genuinely
believe that he's like I think you're
right I just also think upright like
it's fascinating to me that he
desperately needs to become a rockets

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:fan or his life is gonna be not as good
this is incredible I hear should you
become a rockets fan bro I am I love
learning I was dude this is the whole
thing you can't say you are when the
fucking Rockets go to the NBA Finals

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:play against the Cavs and you're fucking
like yeah Kevin Love I got you I I'm
getting what you saying yeah I love The
Rocketeer more after cp3 came I look so
pleased I cannot wait by the way I
cannot wait to play Gary Vee in the Gary

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:Vee biopic in Whiteface I know all the
mannerisms I know the insane theories I
love by the way I love that you stick to
your to win I broke this is not a joke I
genuinely really fucking Crockett's fan
that his life would be better I'm like I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:literally understand the crux of your
argument this is something
for me this has happened with me and
health and other things like I've been
eat in two days and I'm fascinated by
this because I intermittent fasting I'm

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:just fascinated by that I think we are
completely under estimating the
capability of a human being and we just
are just doing that I think practice you
know it's funny this is going back to
you you know you just used it like the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:flab the repetition yeah
I really believe this stuff I believe
the people you hang out with I think
when you keep doing things that become
uncomfortable they become yes this is
fascinating yeah yeah I mean it I think

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:it's kind of weirdly do you want to hear
something funny
I think it's practical I think it's
practical to disrupt yourself especially
if you aspire to yeah I think it's
interesting but you have to like that in

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:the 18 to 30 yes you have to kind of a
school with being like I went to the
family wedding and everyone made fun of
my name cool I'm out I live outside of
the Hat remember the matrix there's the
scene where he's cut eating the steak

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:and he goes you know that's not really
steak and goes I don't care tastes
delicious
people who like living outside of the
matrix like being like fuck that I don't
want the snake they just thrive off of

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:that they thrive going yes this family
partying being like yeah I'm the Freak
and that's fine but you have to be
that's why I think it's really
interesting when you you and you're
advocating people like it's harder and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:harder later later in life let me be
like let me tell you what's interesting
when you add yeah and I know you do and
I know you do
I I think what's interesting is I've got
the benefit of the feedback in my inbox

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:it's been fascinating I'm proud that
some of the content I make gives people
guts to do something they've always
wanted like I find that encouragement is
incredible yeah like it's encouragement
I think I I think you doing you and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:putting out the content your existence
is inspiration people ask all the time
like what what is he doing the thing
kind of what Gary Vee does and what the
rock does it just gives you a touch
point to be like I just got in a big

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:argument with my aunt she says I'm
stupid you go to their account you're
like oh he's lifting right now I'm not
supposed to write I'm not supposed to be
like in my room being like my chachi
said this my caller said that do you

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:know you're supposed to do what scares
me about the image ads what I think of
it is so I'll tell you something else
that I want to touch on because I want
somebody to hear this one person and it
makes them actually do I'm worried about

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:how the story
place out there are so many immigrant or
tight-knit family that's used tight-knit
families because I think that's a better
way to go there's so many tight-knit
families where they are appeasing their

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:parents I love my parents so much it
actually hurts my feelings like like I
don't know how much you guys look but
the public events that I pet is a
promise right like what are you there
when I write I can't publicly talk about

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:my parents without crying like I love my
parents so much it's uncommon to get it
I'm so worried that a lot of us are like
that that we do things to appease them
in the short term and then resent yeah
I'm scared because I'd rather have the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:short term pain of him this doing it now
letting the market play out what we
don't talk about go show me all the
brown kids all the Russian kids that are
60 and 80 with their parents I know the
60 and 80 year old relationships they're

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:broken because the six year old followed
the 80 year old and they've had 35 years
of shit relationship because they didn't
marry that girl right right because they
didn't try that thing and so I think the
short-term pain of a band-aid rip yeah

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:versus cancer yeah that happens in the
back half of every one of these people's
lives is an important conversation
that isn't being debated enough yeah
that's it I'm excited about it I'm
excited that I want I want him to become

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:a rockets fan man that's your yeah
you're really you really are like a
school counselor oh I know I wish
because I get from me from me like look
being at the Daily Show there was a lot
of here's the thing a lot of people were

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:like like Van Jones reach across the
aisle yes Vince those people to see and
they'll see the light or CSI I'm less
interested in reaching across the aisle
yes of people who want to ban Muslims or
build a yes I'm not connect I'm more

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:concerned about what are all those
people and all those swing states that
just didn't vote that we're like that
got stranger things whoa and did got
instead of voting right those are the
people I'm trying to reach you know why

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:in Wisconsin who's on a soft yes yes
yeah fucking I got a warm-up for the
softball games yeah yeah just go come on
man one day just go cast your vote be a
part of the process reaching those
people

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:rather than going over being like don't
build wall by rock do you watch
documentaries love documentaries did you
watch the multiplying one one oh and I
didn't see the sounds cool you need to
you'll like it okay it's just culture

name:Hasan Minhaj

ask it question of the day what is the
new move that you're gonna add to your
game this year that's gonna help you
maximize your talent I love it and I
never do this but I'm gonna add this

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:will you become a Rockets fan huh he's
not you keep asking questions we'll keep
answering yeah I'm a real fan
[Music]
so tell me about the daily show because
I was curious about when you had the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:opportunity to have that audition if you
realize the weight of of it or the
opportunity that was there and could be
going yeah man and the daily show is one
of those institutions where it's not
like SNL where there's like a cast of 12

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:to 15 players there's maybe five
correspondents and they stay for a while
so when someone leaves it's like a big
deal like there is a slot that's
available but I remember being at this
point where when I got the email I go I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:can do this but I remember the pressure
of it being like well what if you mess
it up yeah and I remember I was with the
comedian friend of mine Leo flowers and
Leo was like but that's what we live for
don't we they not you know you're now

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you know you're alive like there is real
stakes but I was such a fan of the show
I put together my own tape I put
together my own tape of what they wanted
me to do and I put together a secondary
tape of a field piece I shot myself with

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:my friend yeah and I sent it to them and
they were like yeah Jon wants you to
screen tests
you know I got a stop you for a second
just to say that yeah that is how you
take a big opportunity because anyone

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:can do that anyone can make that effort
sure but it's funny how most people
don't write and I remember there were
people that were like you know that were
on my team at the time that we're like
you don't have to do this you know

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:they're not asking you to do this just
turn in the homework assignment and I
knew I told my my team this I was I go
I'm not gonna win this boxing match on
the cards I have to knock this mother
out but it was that first thing and then

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:they said hey you have to you have to do
you have to come in and turn around in
an audition and can you come to New York
in two days two days two days yeah just
John wants a screen test with you I'm
like okay let's do it I'm panicking I'm

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:like I put all my they want to see
something current right you you can't
take something that was yeah killed with
six months no no right and so this is
again is called The Daily Show yeah and
I remember something happened on Bill

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:Maher and I wrote this big chat called
Batman versus Bill Maher where Bill
Maher and Ben Affleck went head-to-head
and then there was this joke at the very
end and John was promoting his movie
called rosewater yeah remember he did

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:the last year of the show he also
directed this movie who's promoting that
he wanted to direct and there was a joke
in the in the chat where I make fun of
John and a couple people told me they're
like probably shouldn't do that it's

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:your first time meeting John your screen
testing don't make fun of the movie that
don't make fun of John and I was like no

text:really clicking we're vibing and I can
feel it's in my back pocket I'm like do

the movie I just remember like thinking
in my head I was just like all of us
just no regrets do it empty the tank and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:I just remember I did the joke and he's
just started laughing and I hit the joke
was something along the lines of like
it's like your movie rosewater it has it
has an 83 on rotten rotten tomatoes
right now and and then John goes it's an

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:86 and I go nobody seen the movie and I
keep going back to the chat and he
starts laughing and I remember then the
writers started laughing and then I
finished the rest of my chat to the
camera and I and in me I could feel it I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:was like I was really proud of myself
not not because the joke it's not the
joke was like incredible or
groundbreaking it's the fact that I

terms

whole esoteric crisis in your head like
what am i bringing to the table what did
I do
I just this morning we listen to our
podcast from June 2011 was it good it

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:was remarkably good so my friend Neal
was like you need to go back and listen
to it okay
you'll hear young custom in hives okay
all of his thoughts but you're pretty
fully formed even though you kind of

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:took the mick out on yourself you're
like I'm not right right you sounded
pretty coherent okay which is good okay
what were you not I I mean I just wasn't
even I was born ready
guys I just came out you know I didn't

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:come out Prague I came out loud but now
man I want to give you a real shout out
you stay in touch like you hit me up you
like my stuff on Facebook yeah and yeah
man you're just a good friend I trust I
tried it this is my general rule I know

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:calling sometimes picking up calls is
tough because we all have meeting yet
life and commitments and stuff like that
but I think a text back and being
transparent is the best thing you can do
I think it's cool I think a lot of

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:people aren't like that which is nuts
yeah but haven't you found the older you
get actually there's been two things and
I think I've failed at the second the
first thing is that if you can just tell
people oh we're playing Connect four

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:this is the first part of the game is it
yeah this is getting out right there we
go if you can just tell people upfront
whether you can or can't do something
sure especially if you can't even if it
is front loaded with awkwardness yeah

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you're preventing far more pain mr.
quickly oh is better than a slow yes
yeah but it's just that that jolt of
like hey you're a jerk or hand
disappointed hits you first Yeah right
from your friend I know it hurts like

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:weird
feel that in your body like when I say
no to people where do you feel it like
is it in your head is that like burning
in your ears that yeah if feels like
anxiety might like my general torso and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:right you know what I mean I'm like I
could feel bad and they're not but
sometimes like you felt this like you
you just can't scale everything yeah I I
can't I just can't get it all in you
know we're both anyone we're both

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:married right so yeah yeah it's just
like baking issues it's true you're
right yeah so that's it or just like
straight up just work commitment you
know well I mean so how do you say no to
people you blown up huge right right you

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:could ask to do a lot of things things
that you don't want to do or you know
maybe not able not willing whatever I'll
just say you know thank you but maybe
you know I can't I can't do it like I it
literally doesn't work in my schedule or

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:just being pregnant like okay so
straight up like hey that thing that you
want me to do I appreciate you asking me
to do it you want me to host that thing
or you want me to come to that thing
it's just not my thing but I appreciate

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you yeah like do you know I'm just being
like it's just not my jam we can't do
everything you know anything yeah they
say can be everything but you can be
anything but not a bit no no but like
you've hypothetically let's say you want

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:it to say no to this okay do you want to
host the NHL Awards right and you're
just like yeah I could like but if
you're just yeah I'm I'm not interested
it's not my thing
what the puck and yeah anyway yeah oh

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:that's stuff right you just be like if
you're just straight up just like hey
just look it's just I might you know
yeah so you treat it like a breakup but
a lot of Brody you know but yeah and
it's like totally I think you're cool I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:think you're great but let's just not
stop that right there yeah and I think
the second thing and I'm still bad at
this but I saw this from Jerry Seinfeld
huh is just try to be five minutes early
to stuff Oh

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:today I wasn't yeah yeah but I've been
notoriously bad at this yeah that like
on time isn't enough be five minutes
early yeah like on time is late
people say dude that's hard I did
comedians and cars

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:and coffee with Jerry Seinfeld Wow which
was crazy right bananas he comes and he
picks you up at your apartment he was at
my apartment waiting outside Jerry
Seinfeld denim blue blazer white Oxford
Nike Shox the classic Jerry Seinfeld fit

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:outside of my apartment building five
minutes early standing there standing
there with his hands in his pockets
waiting for me to come out of the double
doors and I'm like dude this guy's a
trillionaire significantly more success

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:like five minutes or at least five
minutes early right beyond just him
being Jerry Seinfeld I was just like oh
man I'm the one who's like running with
bags I'm the one who doesn't have his
right stuff together so that's the first

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:thing so you talk about just like mental
edge he already has that he already has
that yeah and then when you start
hearing stories about other people that
are in his sort of weight class and you
have different fields jay-z other people

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:that they're five minutes early that
they're early I was like man that's got
him I gotta be better at that not like
if they can do it it's like if we all
have that end 24 hours in the day yeah
he's going and he's still doing it

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:that's the thing he's earned not doing
yeah having to do it he's earned being
an hour late yeah and you're still like
oh thank you
it's almost like they're playing on your
court yeah it's almost like welcome to

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:practice yeah thanks for showing up I
was already shooting around yeah I'm
sweating yeah I mean I'm pretty
consistently five to ten minutes late I
just always have why is that I didn't
respect the other person I'm saying for

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:me like you just you don't respect to
them no I mean I just I don't know
there's why are people late I don't some
someone tweeted you know I'm gonna be
late because of the person I am it's
just like hilarious like this is who I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:am as a person or whatever I'm like yeah

I'm a really this in that for us a lot
of times we're collaborating we're
working with people I get mad at myself

be the you know yeah you should be

chopping it up I mean it hours right
yeah yeah breaking it down
yeah whatever we did yeah those was like

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:some of the funnest times in my life
yeah I mean think about like the
conversations you get with comedians
colleagues like during this window of
time
yeah like kind of before you're married

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:when you're still in that like hustle
growth mode where you're just growing
involving like it's it's a pretty
awesome time it was yeah we talked about
that on the podcast well like these are
our good old days yeah but I do

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:everything I can to recreate that now
still mine is mine I think I lost track
I'm looking yeah they get your Jersey
okay cool hopefully somebody's referring
that oh no but yeah no I mean I thought
that was kind of cool like I watched it

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:through a different lens because one I
know you and two like I did a one-person
show about my dating life brah hey it
was like interesting to see the
direction in which she went and just I
mean the production quality was just

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:insane right now which I mean the show
is good too it's not like that
no that's the schools but when you talk
to other comics the biggest thing that
they're talking about is that they're
like aw dude the the visual storytelling

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:of it you've paid to the nice pictures
so we have media and whatever else yeah
cuz I thought that'd be a great it's
like a great YouTube comment on
someone's said if they just don't like
the comic you're like great crowd okay

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:just like give me props the people who
are literally not on stage yeah I'm but
I noticed that I felt like you started
evolving and developing more as an
artist when you went back and started
watching like the old classics and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:dramas and stuff you weren't into that
stuff before when I would talk about
that Best Picture or whatever and then
you're like yeah man I watched The
Godfather yeah when I watched that so
like I felt like that was an area that

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you know you started to become much more
well-rounded in it just showed yeah I
think just exposing myself to other
genres was really good yeah yeah yeah
have you made it I made it yeah I think
I made it I think like financially I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:think yeah I think in that way but I
think creatively what's so cool you know
and with the passing of Dick Gregory
you never make it you know it's you just
continue to do this thing
sure yeah I think that folks have not

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:right the reward of stand-up is you get
to do it and like the that what's so
cool is you know like as I get older I
realize that like man I used to want to
be an athlete so bad and now I feel for
them if you're 34 35 you're on the tail

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you're almost done or you are done oh
yeah at being an athlete it's a wrap
something you did your whole life you're
done don't you feel like we're just
getting started
yeah for sure like don't you feel like

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:oh man like it's just getting good
I just felt like my new my mom's dad
made it to 98 I just found this out
which is crazy on my home just finding
this out my dad's grandparents made it
to 104 Wow

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:so so God willing you're gonna be here a
while God willing and shelah like yo yo
I didn't put that on you that's you
that's you doing Sharia law yeah it's
infiltrating the country man hotel Adia
seriously no yeah I just kind of felt

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:like it's good to be on the grind on the
hustle but pace yourself man you need
something to do when you're like 97 I
mean you know like I can't be like oh I
have to host the Oscars by the time I'm
50 it's like yeah that's cool but you

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:could also host them if you ever if I
you know God willing get to that point
it's like you can host so when you're 80
dude it's fine that happens like right
whatever big an accomplishment whatever
goal you have you got a lot of time

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:right I mean also it's just like but to
me that to me the fun of it is like what
other colors can you paint with or what
are the new elements or things that
you're adding to your act or adding to
your body of work that's what's really

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:exciting yeah of like oh man like I'm
gonna try this thing right you this I'm
gonna try doing a movie like this or am
i doing little a show like this that's
what's really cool yeah there's sort of
no limit to it when you talk about it

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:that way I think the real question
you're trying to ask is like
and it's all predicated on like are you
hot right now making it is like oh are
you the thing but that window of you
being like white-hot of any artists

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:being like white-hot is right this much
yeah martina navratilova just said the
tennis player the moment of victory is
much too short to live for that and
nothing else
yeah like wow that is good because it's

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:like as soon as you win last point it's
like what if they're gonna defend that
year like okay there's like the ball
it's still bouncing after going through
the hoop yeah and you're asking are they
gonna yeah actually I mean think about

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:it you get maybe that that you get maybe
that press conference the headline the
next day right you do ESPN First Take
yeah in like within 72 hours or 96 hours
and you're like they're like baseball
season yeah you know what it's like it's

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:done um and so to me I'm like that sucks
there's people that people that stretch
that that that window as long as you can
write it like you know you're LeBron
James you're Michael Jordan's they have
that window for a short time but man

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:like a jay-z even had this really great
New York Times interview recently where
he's where they asking like do you think
you're the hottest rapper no I'm not you
think about music and you love music
yeah a new thing a new artist comes all

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:the time totally especially in hip-hop a
Kendrick will have the crown or like
hard to be now - Nicki you know you
think like a little way and will be like
oh man Lil Wayne remember Lil Wayne was
like oh he took the throne and Kendrick

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:Lamar happen and drake happened and that
you know it always sort of shifts so i
think the bigger thing is that as we
live longer and longer and artists get a
chance now because of the way we
disseminate information and do work wow

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:it's like i think the real challenge for
us is like what's your body important
yeah and that's what society like I
think about that too I'm like there's so
many things I want to do like for an
hour next year whenever I want to talk

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:about
so I'm gonna talk about that I think as
long as you haven't even or not an
acting class right I mean as long as you
have intent then you're still alive
you're still moving do you think there's

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:anything you can or can't do can can or
cannot do
yeah do you ever go like remember like
if you think about 15 years ago you're
like I can't I can't I can't write and
produce my own movie

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:how would you it's impossible right it
just seems yeah I think of what blows my
mind is writing a TV show like a movie
stole event-based
a TV is is character based so they have
to come up with situations every week

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:like that that's my I'm going to me like
writing the wire that's nuts
we're like writing an album it seems
hard writing a movie seems hard but it's
an event it's one thing it's done but
something that isn't perpetuity that to

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:me seems really really hard yeah but you
know it's like I don't know who knows
what ceasing ethnic alyssum says and
departed you know it's just such an easy
quote like who knows what's easy but
it's true like I don't know like

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:whatever you're good at I guess is easy
to you you know yes if you're not good
at something it just seems like I agree
with that yeah you know yeah I'm not
good at connect for all but on their
defense the entire time evidently so so

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:I guess the way I look at it like have
you made it I think we talked about this
years ago which was can I just say this
real quick that's one of my favorite
things where you were saying just
playing defense the whole time this is

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:just like my like my personal MO yeah
anytime I'm in like a weird I'm in a
weird head space I'm like are you
playing offense or are you playing
defense Oh interesting
yeah like even career-wise everything

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:like so that's what I'm going online and
I read YouTube comments so you read
people diatribes on Facebook no but this
is my this is my personal this is my two
cents on it like and I enjoy me I feel
those emotions right Kevin Durant

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:why did that cupcake leave OKC and go to
wait what right
what are you doing what changed my what
is his does his life have to do anything
to do with me it was in Bronx Tale where
he goes the mob boss cos Mickey Mantle

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:doesn't care about you so why should
should care about him Wow your dad yeah
yeah gonna pay the rent yeah yeah yeah
your daddy
like you had Michael Jordan posters is
like why what do you worship this guy

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:doesn't care about you yeah yeah I just
have Michael Jordan posters and my
Michael Jordan Scottie Pippen like all
these basketball player Hakeem Olajuwon
all the stuff on my wall he doesn't care
about you like why do you have them on

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:your wallet he does not care about you
but maybe he does now maybe Michael
Jordan a hundred percent of the but I
like I know I love the point that he was
making of like you living and dying by
their accomplishments is like that's not

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:meaningless but it's just like I get it
it's been such an Indian dad move to say
that yeah but but what that does does
force you to do is go
oh yeah like Russell Westbrook's
accomplishments and or bank account has

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:no impact on my life
yeah so I have to be my own Russell
Westbrook yeah like I had to broker my
own either oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that's
what's up
[Music]

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:so I guess when I think of like have you
made it let's break that down in terms
of like painting the moments so the
inflection points of how you got to
where you are so I think of that in
terms of like when is the first time you

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:even thought that you might be good at
stand-up you hadn't tried it yet
but you're like yeah like did you first
think I'm funny or did you think I'm
gonna try to stand up what came I think
I think I just I thought I had an

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:interesting perspective and when I would
do like Speech and Debate and public
speaking in high school and drive it I
would is it me I think it's me okay no
it's you it's you uh when I would do
those things in high school I would

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:always be funny and I would get extra
points from the judges
right so then when I went to college the
inflection point for me was oh stand up
comedy is funny Speech and Debate yeah
so that was funny are you that was the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:whole like that opened it up because
you're a Poli Sci major right yeah yeah
so I'm just like oh I can just make
funny arguments arguments because I all
sort of that to like I think of myself
as a funny idea guy yeah like I'm just

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:funny solutions to problems yeah you
know like that that in and of itself is
like just making that already meant like
how did you get there and I've just had
a natural affinity for simile like I was
really good at saying this is like this

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:yeah you literally said like after you
said simile that was perfect yeah but
people would I would always tell me oh
oh that's such a great you connected
those two things right that's really all
stand-up comedy is totally you take like

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:a generic thing that happens and then
you compare it to something that's more
relatable yeah yeah so then you get the
idea to do stand-up yeah you start
obviously when what was that points that
o3o 204 of force when you just September

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:Oh 404 so you've been doing it for 13
years yes okay and paint the moment for
me like from that point that like from
there to here what do you consider your
leaps and bounds I think the first big
one was you know sort of burning the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:boats moving back home and just going
all-in on doing open mics and standup
I liked that burning the boat yeah
like my ID you got it yeah you got to
burn the boats okay and at every point
you got to burn the boats when you get

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:when you try to get to the new piece of
land just burn the boats and so that was
like hey you're not gonna do the
traditional college thing where I live
in the dorms now I live in the
apartments with my friends like you're

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:moving home you're gonna save as much
money as possible and you're gonna take
your parents car and you're gonna drive
to gigs Wow
in Sacramento in San Francisco yeah so
it's not about you know whatever beer

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:pong and hanging out yeah than that yeah
that's dead
you're doing this now and you've got to
go all-in on this and you do like you
what you don't drink right that's a big
thing I think it is right and it's also

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:because I always thought of it like you
and I would give each other props like
well when you we work really hard but I
remember somebody said about you is like
yeah but he doesn't drink it's a big
thing like Husson eats and lives and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:breathes comedy like everything your
life felt like speaking of offense
defense like you're just on the
offensive you're just I think a big shot
man I got no hob totally hm right right
but I'm very lucky I found a thing that

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:I loved yeah I I got fired from all my
other jobs safeway fighting OfficeMax
fired me I just again like I just
couldn't get myself to do it
I correctly like I quickly saw the end
of the road right right like I was just

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:like oh this is how it ends this is this
is the best this is pointless why am i
selling printers you know like I would
have to get into these whole he's been
head he like what is the point of this
yeah okay I a lot of it swept it and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:like I loved working with Proctor and
Gamble but at the end of the day I was
like what's the endgame like I'm selling
soap yeah yeah not but there's other but
there's more to life there's other
people that are like I'm selling soap so

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:I can go be on the softball team and go
go home and watch Game of Thrones and be
with my family it's fuel for the engine
yeah
but for me I'm like screw that they have
80% of my life I'm giving you 80% of my

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:life so I can watch two episodes of God
nah man yeah but I've got an OLED TV I
made it you know how do you think you
didn't make it yeah like you don't have
freedom you have yeah right like so for
me I was like if I'm at a job and I was

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:living for the weekend
I've lost if I'm living for the scraps
of the week oh man I've lost can I flip
the paradigm where the scraps of the
week are like yeah all right fine I'll
be home and I'll watch like that's

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:what's so cool to me the scraps of the
week where I'm home and I'm like you
want to watch stranger things yeah
that is like the exception not the rule
yeah I'm less excited to do that than to
like write or work on my new show yeah

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:that's then you want like yeah our fun
man Rock says that she's like you don't
work a 95 you want you beat the system
yeah to me that's the thing is we met
yeah yeah and then like I said it's like
okay we're on different levels no no but

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:when you when do you retire death so it
doesn't matter right right if no one
leaves the game no really unless you
choose to you guys you either get like
so rich that you don't want to do it
anymore

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:or you just again choose to you don't
love it anymore you just don't do it
what was that next step then after that
the second thing was all right now you
you've done Sacramento and Davis and you
you're driving to San Francisco live in

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:San Francisco be the best possible
comedian you can they're right right
right
movie San Francisco 1s Comic Standing
okay now move to LA like you're one of
the better comics in the city who you've

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:honed your craft moved to LA and try to
rise rise in the ranks and you know when
I moved in Oh 9 and from the time I left
in 2013 or 2014 that was the thing can I
can I try to build traction and make
make it happen and the next big

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:inflection point was I think you know
getting hired at the Daily Show and then
so what yes so before daily show what
was that point in LA where you felt like
you did accomplish that it was just
little victories getting a TV credit

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:making a video a viral a viral video and
getting you know having that connect
[Music]
fight over that Spiderman was up no no
no I think it was the truth okay Ashton
Kutcher pop okay go face that was

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:like oh that was like a big big
inflection point yeah oh man you can
make something that's purely your voice
and it resonated and pop with people how
much of that was industry versus your
own stuff so like you are always on the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:grind with the truth with good face
things but then you had like
ridiculousness or philosophy yeah
yeah yeah I mean I know you'll say that
the things of which are most proud are
the ones you created of course that's

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:what a lot of craters say but did they
sort of feed each other and what was a
mechanism there
I think they feed each other ish but
I'll just be a hundred percent honest in
hindsight everything that you do that

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you're that you're cast in it's Diet
Pepsi version of yourself
it's low-calorie Rajeev it's just kind
of like a shadow of what you really are
and the stuff that you write and the
stuff that we love the that we as

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:consumers and artists love the most
right
are those like things that when you hear
the full story about it you hear oh that
artist or that writer director wrote the
movie themselves directed it themselves

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:it was their passion project why is that
the like the recurring theme and all
those yeah pieces of work because that's
the best stuff it has the least amount
of notes from the outside there's less
cooks in the kitchen that means that you

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:put the effort into writing that thing
or going into the studio and recording
that thing and that was it was purely us
when did you know you were good like
what is there a point where you're it's
like I'm good at this like and we're

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:always evolving it's a craft you learn
you Dick Gregory the whole thing but
like when do you go man yeah dude I'm
like I'm good I think I had I had you
know like there was Windows a time in my
life where it was just like there would

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:be blips really there weren't like whole
pockets where I'm like oh man I'm really
really good yeah like right now I've
sort of discarded my whole hour right
that that can burn me burn the boat yeah
you burned that and now I'm building and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:my new show right and so like when
people like oh you're good you're funny
yeah but I that I had to burn all 30
minutes from the White House
Correspondents Dinner so I can't use any
of those jokes mm-hmm right I have to do

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:a whole new show yeah and so yes I look
at things that I'm proud of
but with this game that we're playing
stand-up or comedy hmm man you you got
to be back in the gym and when you burn
everything you're back in the gym and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you're flat we're talking about that
right yeah Bobby and it's just like the
moment of victory is past yeah I'm gonna
move on yeah yeah the next one on to the
next one that's your Jay Jay fan out for
huge but do you have any interesting

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:run-ins with celebrities like what are
some cool like fun little moments I saw
you with Steve I okay that was Game
seven like oh yeah oh my god is like
what it's like one of your bits of
heaven dude hey yeah yeah the craziest

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:was like the Met Gala that was a that
was my cuz I was like you Aziz like
Mandy here is yeah but like that room is
like it's like if you did LSD and you're
like hey man like I was in a room and
Madonna was there and Kim Kardashian was

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:there and little Lucy Verte was sitting
next to ya you mean like what it's a
dream yeah that's what the Met Gala is
yeah but it was it's a it's a cool it's
a cool room but I remember I went with
Trevor Noah and this was so cool Trevor

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:gave me like this dope amazing piece of
advice he was just like look man like
don't let don't let fame or whatever
define you know like yeah take take it
out like it's like it's a test drive on
a car yeah like enjoy this like go go

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:enjoy the night but realize there's a
lot of people in this room that if they
don't get invited back the next year
they failed
yeah so it's a trap for them yeah and so
as soon as they take away Fame from you

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:it's as if they took a piece of you away
and man that was one of the best pieces
of advice I ever got
cuz he's such a you know people know
that he's a charismatic charming funny
guy but he's also like a deep a very

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:deep wise soul so the way he was moving
in that room is he was just like wow
this is fun and when they tell me that
I'm not cool anymore I'll have this
memory he's going up hey what's up Nicki
Minaj selfie he doesn't care

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:and that's really cool yeah cuz he's not
taking it too seriously yeah whereas
like there was a lot of people in there
very like yeah and be aware of yeah yeah
I read there's a comic instead where I'm
gonna say who it was but you know I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:can't talk to you at the improv like
because I can't be seen talking to you
like we're at different levels and
people will get into that game just like
wow I mean I guess on one level it's
honest

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:like somebody was somebody who said that
I think it was Teague I was like wow I
guess that's honest on some level but
it's also like but you know how crappy
that is so why don't you change the game
why don't you not be that person right

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:right right
and then when you also like really break
it down when you listen to that sentence
you're just like oh man yeah that's what
I become they're like if that's what you
think like you live and die by oh man

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:I'm sorry
what drives you look I feel gratitude I
feel super lucky like I got I got I get
to do what I love to do and I found what
I love to do at a relatively young age
yeah so I've really lucked out I got a

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:lot of friends that have I have so many
friends with so many different talents
they don't know which way to go so the
fact that I just found what I wanted to
do very quickly and I have some decent
level of talent with it it's just

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:gratitude now it's like men that and
you're in America you got a you got a
press go you have to put your foot on
the gas yeah this is what's the worst
thing that's been out they also wear two
moves away from bankruptcy but I feel

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:like being the kids of immigrants and
like how bad are you really gonna screw
up like what like go for it because
worse becomes worse than me go Bella's
back you're not gonna go to office max
you can work a job that's still like

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:it's not like it's a Shelley's a shadow
when you see that Jim Carrey documentary
on Netflix
I haven't yet I was awesome there's a
moment where he's talking about his um
his dad who's that getting fired

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:he tears up and he says it really taught
me because his dad wanted to be a jazz
musician hmm and he said that what's sad
about that is it it showed me that you
can even fail at a sure thing so if
that's the case then you might as well

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:just go for it
yeah wait he failed up being a jazz
musician no no he wasn't a jazz musician
Oh regular like 9-iron oh I see what
he's like you can you yeah yeah so
swinging at the third strike right yes

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you know at least you went for it I
think I think also like look that being
said pull equally from like be honest
with yourself
I'm never gonna be limber I'm never
gonna make the leak right give it give

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:it a shot give it a shot but yeah but
know that like hey this may not be
written for you and by the way like
people try to like dupe and deceive you
into like giving the right answer like
hey man don't you want to be a movie

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:star no I know that I don't why do I
have to be right never what you want
every rapper doesn't have to be an actor
yeah that doesn't have to be the new
people yeah it kind of is but yeah but
then you don't have to yeah I remember

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you said that a long time ago cuz we
would talk about you know Aziz or
something I'm just like you know and you
really mature point of view even back
then you're it's like you know whatever
it's written for him it's like whatever

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:his path is whatever my path is whatever
because we're just talking about people
who are big in the game like Russell
it's these you know people just
especially in the Indian game
comedy-wise and you were never never

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:seemed like that's what drove you was
like getting to a certain level because
someone else was there it was like this
is your path that's his path that's her
path yeah whatever
you know whatever is written for me is

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:what its gonna be yeah I'm I'm more
inspired by like I'll tell you something

I just saw him walking down the street
that was pretty cool on maths now his

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:sixth Radio City Music Hall shouts crazy

impressive about that it isn't the fact

text:our things in the world getting better
or worse I don't know man I just I like
to consider myself an angry optimist oh
that's a good way of putting it you know
like I'm not happy with the state of a
lot of things in the world yeah I won

name:Hasan Minhaj

we're we can't do anymore a bunch of
yeah yeah um I look like yeah I consider
myself to be an angry optimist I think
that I'm not happy with the state of the
way things are in the world but I think

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:there's an incredible amount of
potential for good mmm yeah you think we
were going in the right direction
in some ways no in some ways yes like
it's like as I get older I'm just
realizing things aren't always in

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:absolutes yeah and kids see things as
absolutes yeah
but adults have to navigate or hey
there's a lot of gray yeah like yes yes
Donald Trump is president did yes and at
the same time Elon Musk is like making

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:these like tiny little yeah solar
batteries nothing else really oh yeah
that's crazy right it's like that's
light and darkness Yeah right
so I have this weird theory where I'm
like yeah maybe Heaven and Hell exist on

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:earth at the same time well that's what
Hindus believe oh really yeah there's no
there's no like yeah there's no other
thing this is that this is it yeah I'm
there's a collective consciousness and
all that kind of stuff and it's weak no

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:one's ever gonna know right but yeah I
mean that's what I believe for sure is
that it sits here like a few there are
people who seem like everything goes
their way they just they have amazing
lives and and I know some people like

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:that you're like we have what's it
really like I'm like I let's say I know
a couple people whose lives are on fleek
what are their lifeline their well-to-do
they're good-looking they're respected
they seem to be the full package funny

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:smart album
and I've asked them just point-blank are
you happy are you is this it what is
what I'm seeing is this all real like I
want to get to know them right and it
just seems like the other just super

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:grateful and they don't really yeah I
mean but it led me to believe like how
many people do you actually know like
where you just but I don't think people
even those people live in heaven all the
time it's not all the time but it's

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:still like the macro is that good yeah
really seems like that and some people's
lives just seem like they're out like I
just I know some people I can think of
I'm not gonna say their names yeah I'm
just like wow like nothing goes their

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:way just wow that just seems like it's
just Sisyphus just continually pushing
this rock up the hill okay
gosh it just seems hard to be you man
that just looks difficult okay and what
do you think what do you think you're

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:like this I think I'm in the former camp
I think that I have your point of view
which is that I live in the United
States I get to do what I want to do for
a living I'm married to this incredible
woman we owned a plot of land in

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:California I'm an Ohio boy I own land in
California that still blows my mind
right and I get a lot of pleasure out of

text:of tea oh my god and I get so excited
about the idea that I'm soon gonna have
a cup of tea

a number tea bag I love adding my sugar

it's that's life it's just the victory
in that having said that you know that I
get extremely angry over little thing
earlier and that feels like hell
sometimes right man like and then you

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:have the guilt of like to come on you
have it all right you upset but yeah I'd
say overall knock on wood I mean yeah
I'm blessed I don't have incredible fame
and fortune but I don't know if I'd be
any happier if I did I think I don't

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:think you would be I don't think anyone
is yeah I think it's those things I
think it's being happy over a cup of tea
oh yeah the fact that you can get that
into it yeah it's crazy do you feel
happier now than you were a few years

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:ago or is it the save you the same level

bit but I think it's
tap happy from I just love the process I
just love like pouring myself into work

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:into a story into what I'm doing and
seeing it become something is really
cool I realized with myself that when I
look at projects especially as there's
like a means in an end if I look at
things as a means I'm miserable if I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:look at it as an end I'm happy what do

like I wrote this thing taking a stand
toward an 18 cities yeah they got
invited the performance Spotify first

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:stand-up show ever there is what we were
told and it was like if I'm like what

of goal like you get to do this great

name:Hasan Minhaj

convicted of a white-collar crime which

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:one do you want to be convicted
convicted of a white-collar crime
banking cuz you get off yeah clearly
that's true I thought as a white person
I don't know about a brown person I
don't know maybe you will do they even

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:do do the brown bankers that get they
don't get thrown in prison do they ah no
because yeah and they can there are
states that have laws like Florida or
they can't confiscate your assets and
you're still falling out you may go to

text:like minimum security prison yeah and
all that kind of stuff so you get away
with it yeah like that's the new like
you want to be you want to be like a
legal drug lord just get into banking
yeah

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:what's this live exciting most exciting
live sporting about you've seen a game
seven NBA Finals yeah the women LeBron
the block yeah yeah I mean I saw it live
man I saw it there so it is so crazy in
the silence that was in that room Oh

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:Mike I can't tell you how happy I was to
see the entire Bay Area just get their
life sucked from them you blew a 3-1
lead
you blew 3-1 lead yeah they came back
Cleveland came to Golden State an hour

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:straight up jacked you yeah it was
incredible
with all this when all the chips
are down yeah ridiculous that should be
the ending when they say the best
paintings have already been painted yeah

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:they say that about paintings would you
say that about stand up I think there's
so much room that's what I love about
art man there's so much room where music
is going and there's so much for more
comedies going I don't see the music is

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:getting better
I think musics getting yeah man dude
we're living in a time where there's so
much music and there's so many people
getting to experiment and create their
own little sub lanes yeah it's not about

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you know now we don't live in a time
where Jimmy Iovine has to say okay
you're the one
yeah no gatekeeper yeah yeah so what
that allows us that there's like this
plethora of styles and of musicians and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:cross pollinating within genres and new
genres being formulated underneath
largely anonymous dude it's a great time
I think the same thing with comedy like
the world is getting smaller by Netflix
like absorbing all this different comedy

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:content artists are seeing different
people's work its elevating our game
through I think we're living in like a
renaissance for art that's awesome
that's a great that's a great way to put
it that's an encouraging way to put it

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:[Music]
you would ask me this question and then
I think it was like the Steve Jobs
documentary rest in peace a great men
cannot be good men yeah you would ask me
that new to the first person I'd ever

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:yeah say that do you think can great men
be good man yeah I've seen it with my
own eyes now Wow yeah Jon Stewart
Stephen Colbert our ex like in character
excellent men and what they've
accomplished in their life undeniable

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:goats in there good people amazing
people and they've set and it they're
amazing people because of the way they
treated people when the cameras weren't
on they set a precedent at work that I
think is really great and I just I hope

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:I can do what they do how many animals
have you written you made like a horse
sound that was horrible one sign of
athlete that was amazing
horse elephant when I was a kid donkey
donkey it's um probably has like affairs

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:yeah affair three three three yeah and
you go by it yeah worse elephant human
yeah yeah piggyback ride piggyback ride
yeah does that recenter that's the I
don't know yeah right on your back
pretty right you know that's what I'm

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:doing with this show yeah
[Music]
would you have inspiration where do you
feel not coming your body like when you
get an idea for a joke or whatever else
I wasn't just factor like the moment of

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:truth is like you get the idea and then
you only know it works like that's our
first moment to show you the second
moment that's when it works on stage and
third is like when people caught it back
to you that's insane yeah oh my gosh I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:love that one joke you do and they tell
it to their friend when you're there
that's very cool that's off yeah to me
it's just like seeing a comet or a
shooting star or lightening it it's
these little blips it doesn't happen -

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:yeah it's hard to contain it yeah yeah
it's hard to put lightning in a bottle
that is but it's it's like if that's the
whole game it's chasing that
when you make something good or good or
bad do you know it like before you go

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:out there do you just not know until you
go up like do you have a sense of like I
think I don't know I won't clown
anybody's art but I'll just say that you
know you see some crap out there and
you're like to take everything that was

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:gonna be good like have you ever been
surprised
I like pleasantly we're like I don't
think this is gonna work like it was
there a bit like that for you that you
felt super personal and like man I'm

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:amazed at that work it's interesting I
think my instincts are getting better
where I'm quickly be able to delineate
it and say that's a good take that's a
good joke that's that's kind of weak
mm-hmm but then there will I will still

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:be surprised at moments where a tag will
just like that you just sort of like set
off the top of your head
you just sort of was an aside makes the
audience yeah lose it you're like that's
where it okay yeah yeah yeah that's

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:always a pleasant surprise like yeah
yeah you know whatever yeah are you a
morning person only when someone dies
warning anyone of you for a comment I
mean like 8:00 8:30 I think it's pretty
early but no I mean I kind of wish I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:could get up in like 5 6 a.m. I did
today for this but yeah normally no it's
very very that's why I don't work in
corporate America that's the number one
thing when you're like what's the best
thing my comedy like I don't have to

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:look at them more that's the best thing
oh right you do right because dailies
yeah yeah are you or you become I need
to become that's one of my big goals
I got to become morning become early
like get get there 5 minutes early and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:yeah like I'm talking about like 6 a.m.
I can't operate at that level yet but I
like everybody that I know that is able
to get a lot done yeah even if they're
working till late at night you just have
to start early it's but I think

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:what's hard is God's time about this
with her show but with my wife I'm like
we're trying to get kind of on the same
schedule or whatever but we will both
work from home which is great so I can
go hit mics do whatever at night all

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:that stuff it's like i-i've seen her all
day so it's okay but I can't get to the
point where I go to bed at 10:00 because
what about when I do shows and laughs to
host new stuffs like go do a 10 o'clock
show your body can't feel like oh my

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:gosh I can't
so I'm like I'm not gonna get to the
plumber I'm just consistently getting up
at 6:00 and one about at 10:00 that just
doesn't make any sense right maybe I
couldn't like just go to bed it 12 I did

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:that for when I first got to LA I would
go to bed at like 3:00 and get up at
8:00 and didn't take any naps I just did
that for five years right but it's not
sustainable yeah that's a key yeah
[Music]

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:do you want me to share a thought that I
was thinking yeah where I'm like alright
this is this is like these are the these
are the things that I've noticed so I
think I've been famous adjacent a lot
I've gotten to work with a lot of people

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:that are like really really super
all-time great yeah I don't like the
mulaney's if I don't Stuart it's a sign
files or The Trevor Noah's like yeah
literally like really really like
next-level okay this is what I would I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:think that your gifts are if you have
like these four to five gifts okay you
will be unstoppable okay right number
one this goes nothing do you have a
talent like are you really are you
really good at a specific thing right in

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:the rock is like really buff and he's
really good at that or Kevin Harvick but
he's like buff periodic and people like
him right like it's just like unfair
that's a thing that's a talent just like
be this person is really really

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:beautiful and I can sing like yeah this
person is really really funny this
person is really whatever witty it's
personally British or whatever they're
talented yeah whatever but isn't it
unlike an undeniable right right but

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:these are these are the next things that
people don't talk about okay the second
is do you can you maintain a high level
of energy yeah like I like people that
I've noticed that are like truly
successful kin get up do radio press

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:starting at like 7:00 a.m. mm-hmm and if
you're a quarterback all eyes are on you
and they're doing that until 11:00 p.m.
at night they're hosting a show then
they're debriefing then they're going to
they just keep going a gala then they're

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:going to whatever and they're they keep
delivering and they're and they're
number one on the coffee and all those
things and they have a high level energy
through all of that how hard it is be
like president or a senator like

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:everybody's looking at you you have to
all eyes on me yeah you have to be a
from 658 a.m. when people first see you
till it closes so you have a high little
you maintain the other time yeah okay I
did right I don't like how man I'm tired

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:maintain the energy number number three
can you run on a little amount of sleep
because at the end of the day what I
don't care what I'm saying
what I
how hard I'm working beyonce is doing

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:more in 24 hours than I am
Obama is doing more in 24 hours than I
am Donald effing Trump is doing more in
24 hours than I am like they're working
with the same 24 hours yeah and they're
sustaining that January 1st 2017 until

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:December 31st
they're scheduled they will be awake for
more hours than me
true period Yeah right you can't win
here 71 effing years old whether you
think he's good or bad at his job

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:god damn the guy gets the call hey mr.
president you to come downstairs come
downstairs they spray tan him they
missed the bottom of his eyes because he
does of the swoop thing with his hair
and from the moment he gets up till

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:night whether or not he's bad or good
he's still up for 21 hours and he's
doing it at a sustainable level so can
you run on a little sleep that's the
third that you because at the end of the
day there's gonna just be days where

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:Jeff Bezos has to just be up for 21
hours for 17 days straight number 4 do
you not get sick yeah that's a good one
you never sick it because mortals get
sick yeah yeah these guys and gals yeah
they don't get sick right did you notice

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:like Donald Trump will eat fast food is
morbidly obese didn't get sick on the
campaign trail it's hard his rival his
opponent did yeah right it's it's very
difficult and then number five
so to recap as you're saying that so far

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:okay you have a talent talent and energy
rerun on very little even for not good
sex stay healthy say a game yeah five is
okay so I always think of love luck
drive designer talent so maybe it's one
of those talent you already go to dry

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:drive just you I guess you kind of cover
that desire like maybe a purpose or
something or um what I think maybe
support yeah maybe luck but I think
those those things that I've noticed
I've been like man if you if you have

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:those four oh man
it's kick it's killer so some of those
things are just innate and they're in a
blur you know but I don't think people
talked about those last three yeah the
lack of sleep and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:sustained energy and they're not getting
sick that's true I think people realize
you go to you go to certain people's
lives it's not like oh man I had a crazy
summer know there's people that have
like crazy life they have crazy six year

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:eight year twelve year runs it's insane
that's not you don't hit me yeah that's
a good way to put it and I'll just be
frank I I don't have some of those n
eight things you do get sick get sick I
get tired yeah like I get fatigued so

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:are those things that you can work on
yeah you can maybe train yourself yeah
yeah you absolutely eat well let food be
thy medicine all that stuff yeah I'm
glad we asked you yeah they don't want
to say brother drop some knowledge man

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you do get ill cuz I've seen you get ill
on a mic man absolutely
you're short next week on what do you
bring to the table
if this along the lines of when they say
like belief clings and faith let's go

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:very very good belief is a cover-up or
for uncertainty sure I like insecurity
yeah yeah it's a cover-up oh you night
don't ask you do you believe in
electricity yeah this is it's gonna
shine whether ideally yeah so belief is

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:a cover-up for insecurity but faith this
comes from the knowledge and experience
of the invisible without which there
would be no visible
[Music]
you

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you know as we all know you know we're
Americans we know America's long
struggled with the whole all men are
created equal thing that we put there in
that documentary seems like every decade
or so we as a nation need to ask

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:ourselves you know all men really Oh
black people Asians everybody really all
Eskimos
seriously well lately Muslims have been
subject to the equal people test and
well there's good news and bad news it's

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:the subject of our new Islamic Affairs
segment how all things considered let's
start with the good news
justices ruled in favor of a young
Muslim woman who was rejected from
working at the clothing store

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:Abercrombie and Fitch
she wore hijab to the job interview and
was denied a job because the headscarf
violated the retailers look policy she
won she won it was disappointing that
she was put in that position but she she

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:won she stood up against discrimination
and she triumphed and as a reward for
her brave struggle I am proud to say
that she can now work at Abercrombie &
Fitch
she has won the right to spend eight

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:hours a day in a cloud of Cologne
selling pink polo shirts to guys named
[Applause]
so winning the right to work in a pseudo
sex shop is perhaps a Pyrrhic victory
but that's not the bad news claims of

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:discrimination why a Muslim woman says
she was denied an unopened can of soda
at 30,000 feet she basically was trying
to say that I would use a can of soda as
a weapon okay sounds bad but look you
take that soda you add alka-seltzer and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:a seagull and you've got yourself a bomb
on an airplane I mean there's there's a
reason that they don't let you bring
seagulls on airplanes
that's weird when the seagull blows up
they're the appendages stay intact

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:now you can agree or disagree with the
airline's policy on distribution of
unopened cans but are we really sure
this is discrimination she asked the man
next to me what he would like to drink
and he requested a can of beer and she

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you know I noticed that she placed it in
front of him and it was a closed
beverage can okay okay seems like a
double standard but you think about it
when as a white guy pounding beers on an
airplane ever led to violence it

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:I'm being told almost every time almost
every time well this sounds like a
horrible experience but as with any
situation involving a major airline it
could always get worse I asked the
passengers around me I said did anyone

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:witness what she just said to me and I
said you know how dare you say that I
would use it as a weapon
and then a man sitting you know across
from me said you Moslem you need to shut
the F up that is I am shocked at what

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:goes on in coach am i right I mean it's
can't you just say can't you say to the
person come on sir calm down the Sundays
will be out any minute along with the
live music Frank Sinatra you know in
coach he's still dead but in first drive

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:it to the moon well if there was any
ambiguity about whether or not this
incident had a discrimination component
old f-bomb Johnson settled that at least
now the flight attendant will shut that
down there's no bystander intervention

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:and the flight attendant is has didn't
say anything to him either
oh I feel badly for this woman for more
were joined by senior religious
correspondent Hasan Minhaj Hasan
a shocking story there's a Tara achmed

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:was was on a flight she's an American
citizen I think is an interfaith
conductor at Northwestern University
yeah how does she not have the right and
freedom to enjoy one of our 12 ounces of
delicious yet corrosive sugar water

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you know John actually the airline did
the right thing
you can't risk passenger safety just to
give in to one woman's crazy demands
chest for that's on chest for a kena
soda

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:oh okay John you mean a carbonated
grenade
all right you throw that at someone BAM
they are out like a trout you've just
then thrown away your one weapon and
then you yeah but then you ask the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:flight attendant for another can of soda
a hundred and ninety-eight soda cans
later the plane is yours I mean even
less if it's a commuter flight yeah
Hasan I didn't realize that Muslims were
sort of soda-can MacGyver's it's very

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:well-crafted
your cracker happy yes anything on a
plane is a weapon to a Muslim all right
the corner of a Dorito chip can slice
the net all right you think that seat
cushion is a flotation of device you are

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:wrong that is a smothering pillow you
see a SkyMall I see a paper cut katana
look the this woman wasn't trying to
take over the plane she was just she was
wearing a scarf she was that's all it
around her head yeah a scarf around the

name:Hasan Minhaj

little prop here um this is a standard
scarf right here okay so I'm sure scarf

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:around the plaza this is America from
everything that I that I have learned
about America we love people of faith

is a hierarchy of faith in this country

Muslim oh that art so are Muslims just
supposed to hide their faith is that the

and he had the dopest shoes he had the
Nike Air pennies and I was like those

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:shoes are gonna make me make the team I
said I wanted my mom I'm like mom can I
get the pennies and she's like do they
sell them at Ross and I'm like no she's
like well we have a dress for less
budget so if they don't sell them at

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:Ross that's on you and I ended up
getting a job at the office max in South
Davis and the hardest part is you have
to sell printers to people that don't
know any better so people would come in
and they'd be like I'm looking for a

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:printer I'm like that's great well the
UM Epson 3640 is available right now for
$129.99 they're like that's very
affordable how much are ink cartridges
and I'm like yeah they're about eight
thousand nine hundred seventy two

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:dollars for the rest of the year so I
sold printers for a bit and I eventually
saved up the money to get the pennies
and I remember I took them home I opened
them up I pulled him out and you can
just like smell the leather and you're

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:walking around and I'm like you like
you're constipated but you don't to
crease the shoes she was like walking
like this I was like I'm gonna make the
team in these shoes

text:brown into
because we're not athletic I I don't
know a lot of super athletic Indian kids
eyes okay it's not upsetting but I
appreciate your sense it makes me feel
very good

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:first day of tryouts were all around my
senior year and as soon as I get to the
court I'm like these are way too fresh
to wear to try out so I run back to my
locker and I put my pennies away and I
put on my old shoes and I started my

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:first day of tryouts and mr. G the head
basketball coach he had this drill it
was called fight through the pic and
basically he would take the biggest dude
and you would have to just fight through
him you'd have to just get around him

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:and there was this kid named Tommy
Wilson that's not as a name I'm not
petty but his name is Tommy Wilson and
he was huge like he had like traps like
this is like muscles connected to his
ears to like here and he blow the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:whistle and I would just run my Indian
arms would be flailing
and he's like what are you doing Hasan
right through the pick fight through the
pic like you're trying to get into UC
Berkeley I'm like I get that analogy and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:I ran as hard as I could and I hit Tommy
boom like a force field I bounced right
off of him and I hit the deck hard right
but I gave it my all I gave it my all
and I remember at the end of tryouts
that first day I was drenched and sweat

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:like I look like an immigrant family at
water world just soaked top to bottom
just like effort I did it now we're all
waiting in the parking lot were waiting
for our parents to pick us up all the
dudes are like huddled around and then

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:all of a sudden Tommy Wilson sees me and
I'm wearing the pennies and he goes hey
dude where'd you get those pennies I was
like oh Tommy Wilson's talking to me and
I was like oh I um I got him from Nike
outlet throwing sale right now Tommy and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:he's like nah you got him from the
urinal dawg see during tryouts he went
into the locker room and he pulled out
my pennies and put him in the urinal he
peed in him and put him back in and I
looked down at my shoes and I realized

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:they weren't sopping wet from sweat
they were sopping wet from Tommy's pee
and then my dad's 91 Nissan stanza
pulled up to the front of the group and
I sloshed my way over and
the car and we just drove home in

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:silence like we usually did but this
time was because I had pee in my shoes
we get home the garage door opens up dad
goes into the house I pull off my
pennies and I put them in the dumpster
and I never wore air pennies ever again

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:and then it was the infamous day where
they post the results of tryouts and I
made sure I got up early I woke up at
like 7:00 7:15 I got to class because he
was gonna post the results and I wanted
to be alone that way if anything

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:happened no one could see me and around
7:20 the blinds just sort of shift to
the side and then those hands go up and
they posted the results and my name
wasn't on the list
now I walked home and I ran upstairs and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:I closed the door it kind of set in at
that moment that the dream was over and
nobody plays 1 2 3
I had seven eleven twelve thirteen
fourteen fifteen sixteen seven there's
seventeen players know we had like

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:thirteen when I tried out I definitely
would have made this squad this is slack
they have like five extra players that
day taught me something getting cut from
the basketball team was the best thing
that ever happened to me in my life

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:because I learned that you can't fall
off the floor and even when you do fall
on the floor it's not even that bad the
bell rings life moves on I went to
Chipotle the next day for lunch like

you're working with you're working with
Jewish Yoda yeah and then you're working
with someone who's like your
contemporary who's like your brother oh

same age yeah so was so cool it was so
cool you know what I mean being being
adjacent to him and to see Trevor
filling fill in for those shoes and make
the show his own there's a lot of wisdom

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you get from just one for that process
yeah and watching somebody go through
that what did you learn most about it I
think the biggest thing is that you got
to stay true to yourself and you got to
stay in the pocket and not panic

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:stay in the pocket the Blitz is come a
blintz is gonna come every time but the
great quarterbacks stay in the pocket
they don't panic uh-huh and Trevor's I

charismatic and charming and just off
the cuff funny uh-huh you know what I
mean you just can't tell that he's fazed
by anything yeah I met Trevor
Pryor way before he got to before he got

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:to get rhythm I met him through his
stand-up so oh I thought he was funny so

thought wow yeah that was perfect and it
was a
big swinging is a big chance too right

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:yeah central took they're like all right
we got this international guy know about

I'm not just their patron no no I'm
talking about the content of the
character I just I just you know you
have you entered listen to interviews
with okay well just let's just say the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:transcript of the interview is very
short because there's not a whole lot
being said I mean you frame have to
disagree because okay you know what else
you hate this is the proper political
discourse okay respectfully disagree

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:respectfully disagree your thoughts
about all these suspicious packages
that's arriving at all of these that's
terrifying
yeah really really scary stuff that's
going on right now yeah I think people

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:discrediting it is not real or fake
that's that's a big problem okay okay
what you got over there yeah they just
made an arrest they're gonna have a news
conference later today at 2:30 but they
arrested a man nothing else is known

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:about this man and he was arrested in
Florida so they made an arrest in
relation to these packages yes Wow and
in most of the packages are going to
Democrats or opponents of correct
correct yeah yeah it's really scary the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:type of stuff you'll touch on yeah man I
mean the show we're definitely doing
political cultural investigative deep
dives if you see my stuff before if you
see my special on Netflix and all that
stuff the way I describe the show is you

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:know it's me I perform in front of all
the LEDs imagine if you're at a Drake
concert but you were learning okay like
a Drake concert you like what if I was
also learning about tax reform that's
the one thing you don't learn about

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:anything yeah who's that it's
interactive it's me with all the screens
and I'm telling you no I'm doing one
investigative deep dive on a story so
let's say like our our debut episode
we're doing affirmative action

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:which has been a huge controversial
topic in this country and there's
there's a very very important case
that's going on right now in federal
court where Asian students are suing
Harvard and it could potentially go to

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:the Supreme Court and dismantle
affirmative action that's a big story
Wow that's a very controversial topic
and I just want to talk about it and go
okay let's talk about this because this
is really about how we think about

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:meritocracy in the country who gets what
and why mm-hmm and what people add a
value to a job or a workplace that way
this country is in a monolith we all we
all bring something different at the
table I think that's what America's at

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:its best that's what America's at its
best
yeah let me ask you a question with a
rod do that interview be honest a rod a
rod be able to take something so
esoteric and give you a spresso like

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:that in that moment you're very eloquent
so yeah that's a his degree but he'd be
able to articulate thank you next in key
game and see how well he does all right
now I'm always on your side bro I may
not be on your side but I'm on your team

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:we could we could we couldn't agree the
district now I'm just joking I've never
even watched a raw commentate
congratulations on yourself he's never
that's my homie he work yes yes well yes
I created the show I wrote the show I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:took it out I pitched the show I put
together the proof of concept by brown
paper bag did it myself
uh-huh produced it then shopped it
around and then Netflix ordered the
series and I think I think I'm very

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:proud of that you should be to be that
it to be to truly treat it like an
independent entrepreneurial project you
know as creators of color I really think
that that's important that we do that
because there's two things we look for I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:think in this business which i think is
number number one you in you know that's
looking at the music business you either
want capital ie money or to distribution
mm-hm and I think that if we can control
one or both of those elements you're at

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:a very very advantageous position
yeah you write a rod when I said that
like no but I think that's important to
know and so when people ask me about
this story they go hey tell me about you
know your rise in comedy tell you about

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:this tell me about this and I said look
man I really really treated my hustle in
this game the same way Jeff Bezos treats
Amazon you know how Jeff Bezos pumps all
his money he takes all his profits puts
it back into the business

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:I'm you talk about delayed gratification
that's Vettes something that's not you
don't see that on IG IG is all about
gratification and I think I think if we
really want leverage leverage in this
business we have to control both of

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:those things we put up the bag and we
control the platforms and the
distribution yeah landed though at the
top we hear people say no turn down your
pitch well well actually we because you
know I put together the whole proof of

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:concept of what the show looks like what
we're gonna talk about on the show and
you could you could just press play on
the link we actually had a very
competitive bidding situation and not
another thing you know for me as an

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:artist is like really great but Netflix

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:look at this thanks for having me wow
this is really cool it's a cool poster
where'd you come up with this idea this
was done by our the art direction was
done by the illustrator Sam Spratt who's
super talented Sam did the artwork for

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:the entire show and he's this great
creative director who has done artwork
for childish gambino and chanel monet
and he came out to see the show and one
of the themes that he really loved about
the show was this idea of new brown

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:America and he does these paintings that
are like Norman Norman Rockwell
paintings and one of the things that he
noticed was and Rockwell Ian's paintings
they reflect Americana but there's very
rarely people of color in the paintings

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:so he does this thing like called new
American Rockwell where he puts
protagonists of color in these Rockwell
and style paintings and one of the
things that he saw on the show that he
we really vibed about was how it's it's

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:really an American story and so we just
started riffing we pulled out these
little vignettes that he ended up
putting throughout the show that you see
through the LEDs well you can very
specifically relate this to the prom

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:story that that is in the show right and
the idea of you bringing up Rockwell
immediately now it just feels like a
greater representation of showing up to
the door with flowers yeah I'm here love
me yeah yeah yeah I'm part of this with

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you yeah yeah I think you know like
we've all had these doorstep moments in
some capacity where you're there and
you're you for what regardless of your
race color creator class you've we've
all been in those situations where we

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:put ourselves out there and we're not
accepted
for something that we can't necessarily
control so let's talk about developing
this material yeah backstage three years
ago you start yeah that's right yeah I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:started working at it at the moth um the
the moth story slams and I brought it
out and Catherine Burns the creative
director came up to me after one of the
story slams the theme was heartbreak
so four years doing stand-up and and I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:and I get the topic of heartbreak so I
had to think about what was my first
time falling in love and who is the
first person that I fell in love with
did you see a difference between your
stand-up and what you were doing at the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:moth yeah you trying to bring the two
together or were you trying to actually
craft like you know something else well
with the moth it's it's it's you have to
you're given the topic and then you have
to figure out a story so it was kind of

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:the first time that I had to let go of
the act and then just go alright I just
have to tell a real story and maybe
they'll be funny moments within it um
and I told the story about the first
person that I loved and trying to go to

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:prom with her and then not being able to
go because of her parents and Catherine
Burns the creative director of the moth
was like that's a like what what
ended up happening with you and your dad
and sneaking out to try to go to prom

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:and then experiencing this on the
doorstep not being able to go because
the color of your skin and what happened
with her parents and I started to slowly
sort of ride it out and I started
working with my director Greg Wallach

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:and we then developed it at the Sundance
labs and the the the story started to
take shape as we were working on it so
kind of chronicles my autobiographical
life of my parents immigrating or my dad
immigrating to the United States me

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:being born me growing up with him
meeting my sister but then it focuses on
this love story and it chronicles us
over the 10 years so you sort of already
had the core right when you started and
then it was finding everything going

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:backwards yeah yeah of like so you know
answering that question what was it like
you know growing up in an immigrant
household and so going backwards to that
and then going forwards of whatever
happened with you and her and what

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:happened with her relationship with her
parents and her sort of relationship
with race and identity and all of those
things I don't want to give anything
away but everything sort of kind of
weave together in a way where I can't

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:necessarily take credit for it
um it's sometimes like life writes
better punchlines than you can and I
don't want to give anything away either
it's on Netflix everybody should tune in
and watch it if they haven't already but

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:there is it is like you said it's about
heart breaking it's about one particular
person really yeah that broke your heart
that you kind of got back in touch with
here and there right has this
seem yes yeah how has that yes which is

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:so crazy that mad about it's not
necessarily affect towards them at all
it's so just a personal yeah I have the
story and actually if you with all all
factors considered it's kind of uh it
she comes out on top yeah everyone kind

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:of comes out on top but to me what's
most powerful about it is that it shows
how how much your life can change for
better for worse with one choice and how
specifically in regards to you know race
and identity you know generational

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:change is possible with one she went
with one choice um and that's that's
that to me I think is something
optimistic and kind of cool to think
about so what did she say when she saw
it

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:uh this was weird so she was just like
funny stuff and I'm like what does that
mean that's so loaded but I think she
was you know what's what's great is the
character Bethenny she's awesome and um
her husband is awesome and it's really

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:it's actually very very cool
they're super supportive and cuz the
message behind what they represent and
what the show represents is a generally
positive message that it would have been
different had it ended differently right

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:if you hadn't had that moment with her
all right right right yeah yeah yeah
well you actually had a really
contentious moment with her but then
rewrote it yeah that's not how that went
down

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:screamed at me yeah Howard you just
screamed at me in a restaurant and then
stormed off and got on a plane um what I
love about that moment is the majority
of the show is about you as an immigrant
and dealing right your parents and the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:generational differences there right and
then all of a sudden having this moment
at the end where you relate to a white
person generational differences as well
and how we're all in many ways whether
were immigrants are not sometimes

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:swimming along the same path so yeah
sort of trying to find understanding and
and like I said identity and I think
that was that's kind of a brave way to
take that yeah that makes if that makes
sense maybe it's not that brave I mean a

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:green with white people it's not that
for no no I think I think the thing what
one of the things that I wanted to touch
on in the show and I didn't do it on
purpose but I think it's more relevant
now more than ever

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:I think the country's kind of grappling
with what is our identity um are we the
nativist narrative or are we the
immigrant narrative you know I'd already
written the show before you know the
nativist narrative is like to be

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:American means X Y & Z it's like the
Dallas Cowboys football Jesus Doritos
Budweiser body-slamming reporter your
body-slamming reporters the troops god
bless america
it is the nativist that is it is a very

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:specific sort of idea whereas the
immigrant narrative irrespective of the
amount of melanin you have it's this
idea that America is the great
marketplace of ideas so come one come
all with the best ideas and that's how

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:things like Tesla are created because a
guy from South Africa moves to America
he brings this idea or Apple or you know
you name it um in the thing that I'm
sort of fighting for is this idea of the
immigrant narrative of it it's

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:irrespective we all kind of were
immigrants at one point or another but
that idea of we need to continue to
change and evolve with this great
marketplace of ideas well I think it's
so interesting notice suddenly to be for

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:lack of a better phrase identity
politics right yeah I'm talking about
identity for an extended period and
having it wrapped up in the immigrant
experience and then all of a sudden it
turns and the show becomes about

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:everybody's identity yeah variance
within these sort of confines of the
identity that's been created for them as
a child by their parents right racial
difference right when did you come up
with that was that was that at the core

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:originally as well it's interesting when
I when I first told the prom story it
was basically okay uh it was you know
the the story a lot of young brown kids
go through where your existing in this -
of amin abu think on this but i'm that

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you know am i more Indian or am i more
American and then what's interesting is
when I went backwards and I talked about
me getting married and I explore that in
the show the dynamic between Hindus and
Muslims montagues and capulets I aired

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:out that same sort of - within the
Indian within the Indian community where
there's also this internal strife of
just like Oh loca can get what will
people think that exists behind closed
doors as well and what's what's

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:interesting to me is that - exists for
everybody it's like am I
more this or am i more that and just to
me America kind of is this paradox and
to be that - is the most American thing
you can be it's all America has always

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:kind of been the big guy and the little
guy it's been the nativist narrative and
the immigrant narrative at the same
sights both of those things um and so I
just won't really wanted to explore that
concept of like living in that - I think

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:it's so important that the show doesn't
end on like this is just my experience
and the only mine and everybody just
looked to this one experience and yeah
I'd have you know put that on everybody
else to be like know everybody has this

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:experience no matter what their race or
class or or creed is and I don't have an
order to give the Bethenny read like I
wanted for her to have a voice in the
show - like that's important yeah let's
talk about your White House

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:Correspondents Dinner okay look Donald
Trump wasn't there
ah unfortunately were you were you
signed up I probably should have looked
this up beforehand were you signed up to
do the dinner before he had sad before

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:he had said no hell no I'm not now he
pulled out so at this point it was it
was the thing that nobody wanted to
touch it was just like Donald Trump had
pulled out is the event still gonna
happen who knows um you imagine if he

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:had been there but I don't think you
would have been able to take I think you
would have smashed a table and not know
he would have worked totally I think he
totally would have just sat there I
don't think you would have understood

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:anything of what I was saying yeah
Gerber's in 2011 Seth Meyers roasted him
on that very same podium and if you look
at the c-span footage they cut to Donald
Trump yet and he's just sitting there
like the man in the mountain just stoic

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:he was still you could have silhouetted
him in that moment you could have taken
a pen and literally done a tracing of
him so he would have done that now he
thinks he has power which he does but he
thinks he is insane amount of powers

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:right I could imagine jokes being in
front of him be like what are we gonna
do about this guy
like there's nothing we can do he's
given him like no we can do something
about this like yeah I just think he

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:wouldn't have understood it I kind of
talk fast some of the references that I
were making I don't think he would have
been able to connect the dots I have
friends that work at SNL and they've
told me the same thing where he just

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:kind of just like
like he does that and we're like he's
learned how to make it look like he
knows he's responding and listening when
he's not when he's not like all he
really knows how to do is pick up on

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:certain words like if someone says
dinner he'll be a fantastic fantastic
and it'll kind of go back to sleep and
do this yeah I meet you Jimmy news 71 so
[Music]
my task 65 and he was at the White House

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:Correspondents Dinner and he didn't
catch all of the material and some of
the jokes were about him like the Kosc
Costco underwear joke was about him and
I think it went over his head Donald
Trump is six years older than my dad and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:my dad's an organic chemist he is far
more intelligent than Donald Trump he
wouldn't have gotten anything and to me
that that's the whole font like the fun
in the whole fun thing about the White
House Correspondents Dinner is a

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:comedian gets to get goes on stage and
makes fun of journalists in the
administration to their face that's the
Pacquiao Mayweather dynamic that's
really interesting
people love the cutaways I love watching

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:the cutaways at home in the room I
didn't like it because it was not fun I
mean you get a who was giving you the
dirtiest look I mean Wolf Blitzer
doesn't laugh at anything
he's so stoic the only joke he laughed

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:at was the my dad returning used
underwear to Costco and if you watch the
tape his head back six seconds
afterwards where he's just like the joke
lands and then he's just like ah there's
like a Skype delay on his reaction so

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:very strange room said Costco Haley what
do you got and I said yeah yeah so
you're staring out at this sea of people
you're making jokes all about them
because Donald Trump's not gonna be
there did you frame the material you and

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:the writers frame the material more
around the journalist that we're gonna
be there yeah try to leave Trump out you
know I mean I think there you have a
couple jabs in there about him but like
what right point if he's not gonna be

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:well well my biggest thing was this is
that the theme of the night was honoring
the First Amendment so going into the
dinner obviously a very contentious
relationship between the press in the
administration and the president and I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:wanted to come in as a friend to just
let the press know I hate to say
it you're in an abusive relationship and
he's just not that into you
there's this very never gonna get better
yeah it's never gonna get better but

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:that being said um so desperate for him
to act presidential right time yeah
there's like please just we'll round up
one night the abusive husband brought
home some flowers they're like oh he's a
real husband as I know he's a garbage

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:person but um the theme of the night and
you could see it in the there was this
banner behind me was you know honoring
the First Amendment and to me that
became the narrative sort of tool by
which I wrote the whole set what that I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:was told not to roast the president the
very same president and the theme of the
evening is honoring the First Amendment
so to me the hypocrisy is you don't want
me to make fun of a dude who abuses the
very Amendment he refuses to calm

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:acknowledged who told you not to make
fun of him I mean the White House
Correspondents Association was like do
not make fun of the president and apply
because there's obviously a very tense
relationship and the last thing they

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:wanted to do is have the president show
up in the administration be there and
then be like wow obviously we shouldn't
have showed up because you guys just
came here to make fun of us yeah it is
and it pissed me off too and so to me I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:wanted to I use that as sort of the
narrative framework of the set I wanted
it to be about all right what do we do
now that we're living in the Golden Age
of lying we're living in a post truth
world Donald Trump is the liar in chief

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:he is the king of lying and now we're
living in a time and I'm sure you feel
this working in media where even as you
fight for the truth
Trust is more important than truth in
other words um Sean Hannity could walk

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:up to me be like you have mustard on
your shirt I don't believe you why I
don't trust you Sean I don't trust your
opinion on Muslims I sure as hell don't
trust your opinion on mustard I'm sorry
I'm not looking down right but that no

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:it's not some confirmation bias - yeah
so much of it is you're trusting the
person who confirms all of the bias yes
you have going in exactly the candidate
so whether so whether or not Trump is
liar in chief that's irrelevant when

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:people trust him the most I
but the truth is still the truth and
that's why you know I wanted to close
with this argument that the job of the
journalist is more important now more
than ever because that's how the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:president gets his news he turns on Fox
and Friends and he's like what's
happening in the world and so uh you
know I think I don't mean it Rob I know
he turns on Fox and Friends to find out
what's happening in the world I think he

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:turns on Fox and the friends to get his
annual morning dose of praise you know
like just a few minutes of like the
Trump the president's doing really well
he also watches Scarborough and he's
like all right now he's not saying good

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:things about me now you're my enemy so
he's living in this soap opera but the
thing that I wanted to bring to the
stage was like look now journalists when
you mess up when one of you messes up he
blames your entire groups and now you

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:got to be twice as good you can't make
any mistakes because when one of you
messes up he'll blame the whole batch
and now you know what it feels like to
be a minority and to me putting it that
way to be like hey journalists if now

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:you can empathize with what it's like to
be a minority to survive the age of
Trump you're gonna have to think like a
minority how do they think like one you
got to do twice the work for half the
credit you can't make any mistakes Rock

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:Obama and you got it you have to be a
living breathing Barack Obama yeah which
is so exhausting minority or not we
should all try to be living breathing
Barack Obama sure yeah yeah totally uh
let's talk about these sort of same

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:things uh but in regards to the Daily
Show
yeah and producing and writing at the
Daily Show yeah what you've been doing
for some time you were doing it when
Sewer was there right correct a little

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:bit yeah has it changed and I don't mean
that in regards to Trevor Noah being
there is the host obviously that changes
some things it's a different voice right
but how has Stewart leaving how what do
you think that's changed your coverage

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:of Trump and how you how you cover Trump
what's been awesome is Trevor coming in
and having an outsider's perspective on
the political process and everything
that's going on in the country he's been
really cool because I remember when

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:Trump won we had a live show that night
so the whole show we had written was
like breaking the glass ceiling
Hillary is president now hashtag women
rule and then the results started coming
in in people in the office we're

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:panicking dogs were crying
like it was crazy took pills yes yeah
yeah
and so we're tearing apart the script in
rewriting the script in real time but
Trevor was super calm as a cucumber cuz

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:he had seen this before he's like Oh
Trump is an African dictator I've seen
all of this before Trump is Mugabe
trumpet I've seen this is like
dictatorship 101 and for him to have
that perspective to give us the PlayBook

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:in advance was really awesome that's
something again nobody else could have
brought to the table and I'm so glad
we're doing segments like that like
everyone would have been panicking
rather than you're like yeah how could

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:this happen he's like yeah I've seen
this happen yeah what is he attributed
to or what do you what are you
attributed to what what leads to America
having a dictator um fractured media and
in a globe like economic inequality yeah

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:I don't think it's just I don't like
again I people don't want to be judged
as a monolith I think the narrative also
isn't one monolithic statement like oh
it just boiled down to misogyny or just
racism or just corruption or just

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:fractured I think it's it was a myriad
it was cocktail of all these different
things yeah I believe that I blame the
DC extended universe next up we've got
some questions from right people out
there who has a question

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:hey hey hey son oh good how are you uh I
saw you I was at the pod cat that you
did it in why you a few weeks oh wow
you were talking about like you know
your process and like kind of enjoying
the processes including bombing were

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:there any times where you like really
bombed or like felt like you couldn't do
it anymore I remember this was just a
few weeks ago when I was getting ready
for the dinner the first day cuz I got
the gig three weeks before the dinner so

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:I had to write my first day up at the
Comedy Cellar
um and I worked I workshop the whole
whole set there I went up there with no
material I had just a word doc of just
brain vomit and I was tanking bad like

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:20 minutes
25:24 time init's and I'm up on stage to
like do as much time as you want I'm
like I don't I don't have anything and I
remember looking to the audience that
night they're like you're gonna host the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:dinner Jesus and I'm like to start there
I
member knows worth my head writer
Prashant I was having a panic attack it
was it was rough but like trusting the
process and knowing you'll get through

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:that that was really helpful and being
around other comedians that were like
dude you'll be okay we have three more
weeks but three weeks now yeah not that
much time it wasn't I had to I had to do
like six out tonight it was crazy

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:6s at night yeah just to get it right
hop in adjust to workshop it so you
start with nothing all right we got 30
seconds oke all right now we have a
minute 24 minutes to go like I was
chipping away at it like it was a

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:marathon yeah crazy next question hey
Hudson how are you hey um so my
questions a little political in this
current Trump era there's been a lot of
focus on identity and particularly race
and ethnicity right and a lot of issues

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:are seeing either as like a black issue
or a white issue but Asian Americans
don't really feel their place in like
advocacy so how do you think
asian-americans fit into this advocacy
for minorities I think that we totally

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:fit in civil liberties is an
all-or-nothing game so there's no one
who's just exempt from it uh so I think
we have a huge responsibility to plug
into other civil liberties engagement
sort of issues black lives matter LGBTQ

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:rights like that stuff affects us as
well to me there's no difference between
the the undercurrent of what's happening
with police brutality or criminal
justice reform is the same undercurrent
and what's happening with the Muslim ban

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:or all of these things the war on terror
to me it's about marginalizing people
and pushing out their existence to those
margins further and further it just
comes in different shapes or forms so to
me to feel like we're on the sidelines

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:for this issue is a choice that we can't
have right here um as someone who comes
from an immigrant family yeah I know
usually immigrant parents tend to push
you to take off their conventional path
of a doctor lawyer accountant whatever

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:how did your family react to what you
chose to do uh super disappointed they
were so sad um yeah it was kind of like
um a snake bite we're just the venom of
disappointment slowly killed them over
the years but they're okay now

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:they're they're doing they're doing much
better now as you say in the special
your sister did better so they could
lean on her forever so they gave up on
me and they double down on a show and
they're like we got one and then they

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:could let me develop at the rate that I
was going to develop at which was it not
until the daily show that they sort of
recognized yeah really right Pat yeah
the daily show was like a huge kind of
game-changer the fact that my dad knew

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:who Jon Stewart is and was it was crazy
I was like my dad knows you it was very
surreal I did sort of respond to that
when you told him that yeah I'm sure he
does all right man I'll see you later uh
I think whatever one more question you

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:have like a very wildly prominent
position in the comedy world after like
many years of working and comedy can it
can get a bit tricky when you're talking
about controversial issues and turning
it into something um into the coming

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:comedic like what you did the
Correspondents Dinner so I was just
wondering what you plan to do in the
future with I guess using your position
to make make a change yeah um I just
want to continue telling stories that I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:think need to be told that's really it
yeah how has doing a show like this yeah
changed your comedy in terms of your
stand-up yeah doing a show like this do
you feel more comfortable telling longer
stories that sort of turn into a joke

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:yeah joke at the end versus feeling like
you have to go punchline punchline
punchline to me like after doing a show
like this that has you know digital
stuff behind me and there's lighting
changes and sex I love the spelling bee

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:video oh thanks thanks man great thanks
man um so to me now it's one of those
things where I'm actually for doing more
one-man shows like that because it
allows me to play all these different
notes I can still do the traditional set

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:up punch stuff but then because it's in
the theatrical space there's moments
where you can sort of milk it and you
can have these moments that are may be
sad or poignant and then get back into
comedy later I think having that

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:flexibility to play all those notes to
me is really exciting now you
got this uh Punk should ask you this at
the beginning more beginning question
bution my home from tell yeah yeah what
made you decide to do that all of the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:stories that I'm talking about in the
show um are things that I think affect
communities around the country like a
lot of times when it comes to discussing
race I think like the collateral damage
has to be death for us to talk about

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:it's like alright you know we shouldn't
have killed Trayvon Martin that that but
even then it's like but he stole some
skittle right I know right but but when
it comes out they're like okay he was
still a teenager he shouldn't he

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:shouldn't have died but to me the other
he had one time smoke pot maybe we
should rehab but to me that the tougher
conversation is the stuff that happens
the other 364 days of the year that are
far less bombastic that people want to

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:always shove I don't want to talk about
race now like why does the collateral
damage have to be the highest level it
has to be murder every day people call
our marginalized groups feel this all
the time and it happens at school in the

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:workplace in your community so I wanted
it to be like to bring it back to a
place like Davis California to be like
yeah it happened here and all things
being equal given everything that's
going on in the country right now could

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:2017 Hasan Minhaj go to prom with 2017
Bethenny Reid that's really the case
study that's really what it's about it's
not about oh I couldn't go to prom with
a white girl because her parents were
afraid that I was Muslim in brown that's

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:not the point like I'm growing I'm
married I'm doing well I have health
insurance
I'm doing great the point is is all of
these factors being equal coming from
when I graduated high school to now

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:those variables being equal could 2017
is AA Minaj go 2017 Bethenny Reid and I
think the answer is maybe and that yet
but it's perhaps it depends on what
state you're in like where do you look
like that to me is the conversation I

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:want to have through the show and to
show that if through Bethany in rajesh
ranga ramana john annum it's possible
maybe anything's possible is that his
real name I check did you change it but
it's the same number of letters yeah uh

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:Hassan uh homecoming king is on Netflix

text:WAS IT MURDER?
YIT WAS.
WE HUMANS DID IT.
THE VICTIM IS A TINY RAT-LIKE
CREATURE CALLED THE BRAMBLE CAY
MELOMYS, WHOSE HABITAT ON A
SMALL CORAL ISLAND ON THE GREAT
BARRIER REEF WAS DESTROYED BY
RISING SEA LEVELS OVER THE PAST

name:Stephen colbert

text:DECADE.
THIS IS A TRAGEDY, ESPECIALLY
SINCE ITS LAST WORDS WERE, "I
PROBABLY SHOULD'VE MENTIONED
THIS EARLIER, BUT I'M A TALKING
RAT!"
 (  LAUGHTER  )
NOW, I'VE BEEN PUTTING OFF
SHOWING A PICTURE OF THE
MELOMYS, BUT I THINK I'M READY.

name:Stephen colbert

text:HOLD ON ONE SECOND.
PLEASE DON'T BE CUTE.
PLEASE DON'T BE CUTE.
OH, DAMMIT!
AWWWW, HE'S ADORABLE!
I WANT ONE!

name:Stephen colbert

text:OH, RIGHT.
 (  LAUGHTER  )
HERE'S THE SAD PART:  WE'RE ALL
RESPONSIBLE FOR CLIMATE CHANGE.
THEREFORE, WE ALL KILLED THIS
ANIMAL.
SO I WOULD LIKE TO--
 ( APPLAUSE )
YES.

name:Stephen colbert

text:SO RARE FOR AN AUDIENCE TO
APPLAUD KILLING ANIMALS.
 ( LAUGHTER )
SO I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT
RIGHT NOW AND SAY A FEW WORDS
ABOUT THE DEARLY DEPARTED
BRAMBLE CAY MELOMYS.
DEARLY BELOVED, WE GATHER TODAY
TO SAY GOODBYE TO THIS LOVEABLE
RAT-LIKE MELOMYS.

name:Stephen colbert

text:I DID NOTB KNOW HIM WELL, OR AT
ALL.
BUT I HOPE HE HAD A NICE LIFE IN
AUSTRALIA.
PERHAPS HE GOT TO EAT LEFTOVER
VEGEMITE OUT OF NICOLE KIDMAN'S
TRASH.
 (  LAUGHTER  )
OR PERHAPS HE GOT TO LIVE IN A
CHEF'S HAT AND RUN A RESTAURANT.

name:Stephen colbert

text:THAT'S ALL I KNOW ABOUT
AUSTRALIA AND RATS.
WE'LL MISS YOU, BRAMBLE CAY
MELOMYS, NOW THAT YOU'VE
SHUFFLED OFF THIS MORTAL COIL,
WHICH-- FUN FACT-- IN AUSTRALIA
ACTUALLY SHUFFLES OFF IN THE
OTHER DIRECTION.
 (  LAUGHTER  )
AND THERE'S ANOTHER EXTINCTION
HERE AT HOME-- PAYLESS IS
CLOSING ALL ITS U.S. STORES.

name:Stephen colbert

text:I CAN'T BELIEVE "BUY ONE GET ONE
FREE" WASN'T A SUSTAINABLE
BUSINESS MODEL.
 (  LAUGHTER  )
"WELCOME TO PAYLESS!
OUR PRODUCTS ARE WORTHLESS!"
 (  LAUGHTER  )
SO, LIKE SO MANY OTHER
BRICK-AND-MORTAR STORES, PAYLESS
IS JUST THE LATEST VICTIM OF
ONLINE SHOPPING, WHICH HAS LED

name:Stephen colbert

text:TO A DROP IN FOOT-TRAFFIC AT
U.S. MALLS, A VITAL SOURCE OF
CUSTOMERS FOR STORES LIKE
PAYLESS.
AT THIS POINT, THE ONLY THING
LEFT IN THE AVERAGE U.S. MALL IS
A BATH & BODY WORKS AND A
GRANDPA SOMEBODY FORGOT TO
PICK UP.
 (  LAUGHTER  )
HE'S OKAY.

name:Stephen colbert

text:HE'S JUST GOING TO DO
ANOTHER LAP.
 (  LAUGHTER  )
CUSTOMERS ALL ACROSS THE NATION
WILL FEEL THE IMPACT, BECAUSE
PAYLESS IS GOING TO LIQUIDATE
THE INVENTORY OF 2,100
LOCATIONS.
THAT'S GOT TO BE HUNDREDS OF
DOLLARS WORTH OF SHOES.
 (  LAUGHTER  )
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU

name:Stephen colbert

text:TONIGHT.
HAVE A SEAT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WE'RE HERE BECAUSE WE HAD TOO
MUCH MONOLOGUE FOR ONE MONOLOGUE
SO WE'RE DOING TWO MONOLOGUES
TONIGHT AND HERE'S WHAT'S GOING
ON --
DONALD TRUMP WEIGHS IN ON THE

name:Stephen colbert

text:LAW AND HOW HE SEES JUSTICE A
LOT, BUT THE CASE HE
SHOULD ACTUALLY BE PAYING
ATTENTION TO IS THE ONE FOR
TRUMP ASSOCIATE AND GRANDMA
AFTER SHE GOT INTO CLUB DRUGS,
ROGER STONE.
( LAUGHTER )
A WEEK OR TWO WEEKS AGO,
STONE WAS UNDER A LIMITED GAG
ORDER TO PREVENT HIM FROM

name:Stephen colbert

text:POISONING THE JURY POOL IN
HIS UPCOMING TRIAL.
BECAUSE HE LIKES TO SHOOT OFF AT
THE MOUTH A LOT AND ACCUSE
PEOPLE OF MALFEASANCE IN THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, AND YOU
CAN'T DO THAT.
BUT HE STILL VIOLATED IT BY
POSTING THIS PHOTO OF THE JUDGE
PRESIDING OVER HIS CASE
WITH CROSSHAIRS NEXT TO HER HEAD

name:Stephen colbert

text:ON INSTAGRAM.
BAD IDEA.
BAD IDEA.
IF YOU WANT TO THREATEN A JUDGE,
DO IT SOMEWHERE NO ONE WILL EVER
SEE IT, LIKE LINKEDIN.
( LAUGHTER )
SO HE DID THIS.

name:Stephen colbert

text:IT HIT THE FAN.
SO, MONDAY, HE ISSUED A WRITTEN
APOLOGY, AND IN COURT TODAY
STONE APOLOGIZED AGAIN, AND LAID
IT ON REALLY THICK, TELLING THE
JUDGE, "I RECOGNIZE THAT I LET
THE COURT DOWN.
I LET YOU DOWN.
I LET MYSELF DOWN.

name:Stephen colbert

text:I LET MY FAMILY DOWN."
BY "FAMILY," OF COURSE, STONE IS
REFERRING TO HIS ENTOURAGE OF
TRAINED PENGUIN ASSASSINS.
( LAUGHTER )
THE JUDGE ASKED STONE TO EXPLAIN
THE CROSSHAIRS NEXT TO HER HEAD
AND HE SAID, I DID NOT RECOGNIZE
THE IMAGE AT FIRST AND LATER
THOUGHT ITS A CELTIC SYMBOL.

name:Stephen colbert

text:( AUDIENCE REACTS )
YES, IT GOES BACK TO ROMAN
TIMES, WHEN THE CELTS IN
NORTHERN EUROPE USED TO THREATEN
JUDGES ON INSTAGRAM.
( LAUGHTER )
NOT ONLY THAT, STONE SAID HE
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHO POSTED THE
IMAGE, BLAMING IT ON VOLUNTEERS
WHO WORK FOR HIM.

name:Stephen colbert

text:WHEN ASKED WHICH ONE OF THEM
MIGHT HAVE DONE IT, STONE
STRUGGLED TO RECALL THE NAMES OF
HIS FIVE OR SIX VOLUNTEERS WHO
HAVE HAD ACCESS TO HIS PHONE.
SAYING, "IT'S A REVOLVING
SITUATION."
THAT REALLY SOUNDS LIKE A GUY AT
A HOTEL BAR TRYING TO SOFT-PITCH
WIFE SWAPPING.

name:Stephen colbert

text:"WE HAVE A... REVOLVING
SITUATION."
( LAUGHTER )
STILL, I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT
INSTILLED A LOT OF CONFIDENCE.
"YOUR HONOR, YOU CAN TRUST ME.
I'M A MAN WHO GIVES MY PHONE TO
A ROTATING SERIES OF STRANGERS
WHOSE NAMES I DON'T RECALL.

name:Stephen colbert

text:I ALWAYS FORGET WHO'S IN CHARGE
OF THREATENING FEDERAL JUDGES--
IS IT GLASSES OR
BROWN-HAIR-GUY?"
I CAN'T REMEMBER.
I FIND IT STRANGE THAT ROGER
STONE HAS VOLUNTEERS.
DOES THAT MEAN SOMEONE ELSE'S
COMMUNITY SERVICE WAS WORKING
FOR ROGER STONE?

name:Stephen colbert

text:( LAUGHTER )
THEY MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING
TERRIBLE.
( LAUGHTER )
NATURALLY, THE JUDGE WAS NOT
IMPRESSED, SAYING, "I HAVE
SERIOUS DOUBTS ABOUT WHETHER
YOU'VE LEARNED ANY LESSON AT
ALL.
YOU APPEAR TO NEED CLEAR
BOUNDARIES."

name:Stephen colbert

text:YES, POSSIBLY A BUNCH OF
VERTICAL STEEL BOUNDARIES.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
( PIANO RIFF )
BUT THAT'S FOR LATER.
FOR NOW, SHE GAVE STONE A FULL
GAG ORDER.
"NO STATEMENTS ABOUT THE CASE ON
TV, RADIO, PRINT REPORTERS, OR
INTERNET.

name:Stephen colbert

text:NO POSTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA."
SO, IF YOU WANT TO COMMUNICATE
WITH ROGER STONE, DO IT THE OLD
FASHIONED WAY AND CONTACT HIM
THROUGH HIS RUSSIAN HACKERS.
( LAUGHTER )
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
WELCOME, WELCOME ONE AND ALL TO
"THE LATE SHOW."
I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT.

name:Stephen colbert

text: ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
EVERYBODY'S EXCITED BECAUSE
TONIGHT, TRUMP GAVE HIS STATE OF
THE UNION, AND WE ARE LIVE, IF
WHAT YOU CALL WHAT WE JUST
WATCHED "LIVE."
IT WAS PRETTY RAUCOUS ON THE
REPUBLICAN SIDE, I'LL TELL YOU
THAT MUCH.
PRETTY QUIET ON THE DEMOCRACY
SIDE BECAUSE IT WASINANCY'S

name:Stephen colbert

text:HOUSE.
SHE SHOWED GREAT RESTRAINT.
SHE DID NOT STICK ON OUT HER
TONGUE ONCE.
THIS WASN'T A PARTICULARLY GOOD
SPEECH, BUT WHAT IT LACKED IN
QUALITY, IT MADE UP IN LENGTH.
 (  LAUGHTER  )
IT WAS-- IT WAS LIKE--

name:Stephen colbert

text: ( APPLAUSE )
THIS SPEECH WAS LIKE WATCHING
PAINT LIE.
 (  LAUGHTER  )
NOW, LEADING UP TO THE BIG
SPEECH THE PRESIDENT REFUSED TO
GIVE ANY SPOILERS.
>> YOU'LL HEAR THE STATE OF THE
UNION AND THEN YOU'LL SEE WHAT
HAPPENS RIGHT AFTER THE STATE OF
THE UNION.

text:>> Stephen: OKAY, YES.
THAT IS HOW TIME WORKS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THROUGHOUT THE SPEECH, TRUMP
STUCK TO HIS TELEPROMPTER MOST

FOCUSED ON THE PROMPTER BY

WITH POLICE.
KIND OF HOW IT IS FOR HIM NOW.

name:Stephen colbert

text:COPS HANG OUT NEAR HIM WITH
CUFFS OPEN AND READY.
 (  LAUGHTER  )
TRUMP STARTED THE NIGHT BY
CHOOSING ENERGY SECRETARY RICK
PERRY AS THE DESIGNATED
SURVIVOR.
SO THAT'S IN CASE, IF
SOMETHING-- GOD FORBID--
HAPPENED AT THE CAPITOL
TONIGHT-- A METEOR TOOK OUT ALL

name:Stephen colbert

text:OUR LEADERSHIP, RICK PERRY WOULD
BE OUR OWN HOPE.
AND AN EXPERT ON RICK PERRY HAS
THIS REACTION TO THAT CHOICE:
>> OOPS.
>> Stephen: OOPS, INDEED.
OOPS, INDEED.
STATE OF THE UNION, ALWAYS A BIG
NIGHT.

name:Stephen colbert

text:ALWAYS A BIG NIGHT.
EVERYBODY WHO WAS ANYBODY WHO
WAS NOT INDICTED WAS THERE.
LET'S SEE, DEMOCRATIC WOMEN WORE
WHITE TO COMMEMORATE THE
SUFFRAGETTES.
 ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
BEAUTIFUL.
BEAUTIFUL.

name:Stephen colbert

text:>> Stephen:
>> Jon: YEAH, THAT'S AMAZING.
I LOVE THAT.
>> Stephen: BEAUTIFUL.
 ( APPLAUSE )
SO, SO THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE WAS A
SEA OF WHITE, AND THE REPUBLICAN
SIDE ALSO A SEA OF WHITE.
 ( APPLAUSE )
NOW, AS HE ENTERED, HE DID THE

name:Stephen colbert

text:NORMAL HANDSHAKING, SHAKING THE
HAND OF THE PEOPLE WHO WILL
EVENTUALLY DECIDE IF HE CAN BE
INDICTED.
IT WAS A WIDE-RANGING SPEECH.
TRUMP HONORED SOME WONDERFUL
CHILDREN, SOME WORLD WAR II
VETERANS, SOME FORMER PRISONERS
WHO WERE FREED BY CLEMENCY OR
THE NEW PRISON REFORM.

name:Stephen colbert

text:I THINK HE DECLARED HIMSELF
PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA AT ONE
POINT.
WHEN THE SPEECH BEGAN, ONE OF
THE FIRST THINGS TRUMP DID WAS
INTRODUCE HIS WIFE.
>> MADAM SPEAKER, MR. VICE
PRESIDENT, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS,
THE FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED
STATES.

name:Stephen colbert

text: ( APPLAUSE )
 ( CHEERS )
>> Stephen: THAT'S A REALLY
SMART MOVE:  SAY WHO SHE IS,
THEN WAIT FOR HER TO STAWND
BEFORE ACKNOWLEDGING HER.
 (  LAUGHTER  )
THAT IS THE "HEY, CHAMP" OF
FORGETTING WHO YOU ARE CURRENTLY
MARRIED TO.
HE STARTED-- HE STARTED THE
EVENING-- "WHAT'S UP, BIG GUY?"

name:Stephen colbert

text:HE STARTED WITH A CALL FOR
BIPARTISANSHIP:
>> THE AGENDA I WILL LAY OUT
THIS EVENING IS NOT A REPUBLICAN
AGENDA OR A DEMOCRAT AGENDA.
IT'S THE AGENDA OF THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE.
>> Stephen: "CAN SOMEBODY PLEASE
TELL THEM THESE WERE THEIR
IDEAS?

name:Stephen colbert

text:BECAUSE I'M GETTING KILLED IN
THE POLLS RIGHT NOW."
AND HE TOOK A MOMENT TO TOUT
AMERICAN GREATNESS.
>> AMERICA SAVED FREEDOM,
TRANSFORMED SCIENCE, REDEFINED
THE MIDDLE CLASS, AND WHEN YOU
GET DOWN TO IT, THERE'S NOTHING
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD THAT CAN
COMPETE WITH AMERICA.
>> Stephen: (AS TRUMP):
"HOME OF THE WHOPPER, UNDEFEATED

name:Stephen colbert

text:HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE
WORLD.
AMERICA: IT'S EVERYWHERE YOU
WANNA BE.
BA-DA-BA-BA-BA, I'M LOVING IT."
I COULD GO FOR ONE.
I'M LOVING IT, JON.
>> Jon: IT'S A LITTLE LATE FOR
THAT.

name:Stephen colbert

text:I AM NOT MESSING WITH THAT.
>> Stephen: AND HE PRESENTED A
STARK CHOICE:
>> WE MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN
GREATNESS OR GRIDLOCK, RESULTS
OR RESISTANCE, VISION OR
VENGEANCE, INCREDIBLE PROGRESS
OR POINTLESS DESTRUCTION.

ALIEN VERSUS PREDATOR.
OF COURSE, HE BRAGGED MORE ABOUT
THE ECONOMY:

name:Stephen colbert

text:>> AND WE ARE CONSIDERED, FAR
AND AWAY, THE HOTTEST ECONOMY
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.
>> Stephen: (AS TRUMP):
"IT IS SO HOT, IF IT WASN'T MY
ECONOMY, PERHAPS I'D BE DATING
IT."
>> Jon: OH, NO!
OH, NO!

name:Stephen colbert

text:>> Stephen: "JON, I'M TELLING
YOU, JON, YOU KNOW, I LOVE A HOT
ECONOMY."
THE EVENING WENT ON...
AND ON.
 (  LAUGHTER  )
G.O.P. LAWMAKERS STOOD UP AND
SAT DOWN SO MANY TIMES, IT
SOUNDED LIKE THEY WERE MAKING

name:Stephen colbert

text:POPCORN WITH THEIR KNEECAPS.
 (  LAUGHTER  )
HE MADE A NOT-SO-SUBTLE THREAT
TO HOUSE DEMOCRATS.
>> AN ECONOMIC MIRACLE IS TAKING
PLACE IN THE UNITED STATES, AND
THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP IT
ARE FOOLISH WARS, POLITICS, OR
RIDICULOUS PARTISAN
INVESTIGATIONS.

name:Stephen colbert

text:>> Stephen: "YOU HEARD ME, YOU
GET THE TRUTH OR A FUNCTIONING
ECONOMY, OKAY.
KEEP IN MIND, I TURNED THIS
SUCKER OFF FOR A MONTH OVER A
WALL.
YOU THINK I WON'T BURN THIS
PLACE TO THE GROUND TO STAY OUT
OF JAIL?

text:OKAY.
I'M JUST SAYING NICE COUNTRY YOU
GOT HERE, SHAME-- SHAME IF
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO IT."
 ( APPLAUSE )
IN THAT SAME VAIN, HE KEPT GOING
IN WHAT HE CLEARLY THOUGHT WAS A
LINE THAT WOULD GET A STANDING
OVATION.

text:>> IF THERE IS GOING TO BE PEACE
AND LEGISLATION, THERE CANNOT BE
WAR AND INVESTIGATION.
IT JUST DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY!
 ( SINGLE CLAP )
 (  LAUGHTER  )

REPUBLICANS WERE LIKE-- HEY!
DID HE... WHAT?

ARGUMENT."
"YOU CAN'T HAVE LEGISLATION AND
INVESTIGATION.
WHOEVER HEARD OF LAW AND ORDER?
COME ON.
 ( APPLAUSE )
YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH.
YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE.

name:Stephen colbert

text:YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE.
JON, YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE.
YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME THAT ONE.
YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME THAT ONE."
 ( APPLAUSE )
AND TRUMP TALKED THE TALK ON
IMMIGRATION.

name:Stephen colbert

text:>> NOW IS THE TIME FOR CONGRESS
TO SHOW THE WORLD THAT AMERICA
IS COMMITTED TO ENDING ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION AND PUTTING THE
RUTHLESS COYOTES, CARTELS, DRUG
DEALERS, AND HUMAN TRAFFICKERS
OUT OF BUSINESS.
>> Stephen: AND NO ONE KNOWS
HOW TO PUT SOMETHING OUT OF
BUSINESS LIKE DONALD TRUMP.

name:Stephen colbert

text:( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YOU CAN TAKE THAT TO THE BANK!
BECAUSE THEY ARE REPOSSESSING IT
IN THE CHAPTER 11!
NOW, TRUMP KNOWS-- TRUMP KNOWS
IMMIGRANTS ARE TAKING AMERICAN
JOBS.
>> WORKING CLASS AMERICANS ARE
LEFT TO PAY THE PRICE FOR MASS
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION:  REDUCED
JOBS.

name:Stephen colbert

text:>> Stephen: BUT HE ALSO KNOWS
THIS:
>> MORE PEOPLE ARE WORKING NOW
THAN AT ANY TIME IN THE HISTORY
OF OUR COUNTRY.
>> Stephen:  THE BOTH OF THOSE
THINGS ARE TRUE, IF YOU DON'T
THINK ABOUT IT TOO HARD.
I DON'T.

name:Stephen colbert

text:I DON'T THINK ABOUT IT AT ALL.
OKAY.
YES AND NO."
AND HE LAID OUT A STRONG
ARGUMENT AGAINST ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION.
>> TOLERANCE FOR ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION IS NOT COMPASSION

name:Stephen colbert

text:COMPASSIONATE.
IT IS ACTUALLY VERY CRUEL.
>> Stephen: "I MEAN, NOT KIDS
IN CAGES CRUEL, BUT, STILL,
PRETTY BAD."
THE POINT IS-- AND THIS IS MY
POINT ULTIMATELY-- TOLERANCE IS
CRUELTY.

name:Stephen colbert

text:WAR IS PEACE.
FREEDOM OF SLAVERY, AND I WEIGH
239 POUNDS.
 ( LAUGHTER )

NEWLY CREATED JOBS LAST YEAR.

OF YOU, DON.

WERE NEW DEMOCRATIC WOMEN IN

AND TRUMP SUPPORTED THEIR
CELEBRATION WITH THIS:

TRYING TO TELL WOMEN WHAT TO DO
IS WHY THEY WON.
 ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
BUT-- BUT-- BUT--

text:BUT COME ON, TRUMP ROLLED WITH
IT.

YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE THIS.

 ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
IS THAT NOT WHAT HE SAID?
IS THAT NOT WHAT HE SAID?

name:Stephen colbert

text:>> Jon: THAT'S NOT WHAT HE
SAID.
>> Stephen: AND HE ROLLED OUT
SOME POLICY PROPOSALS TO APPEAL
TO WORKING PARENTS.
>> I AM ALSO PROUD TO BE THE
FIRST PRESIDENT TO INCLUDE IN MY
BUDGET A PLAN FOR NATIONWIDE
PAID FAMILY LEAVE SO THAT EVERY
NEW PARENT HAS THE CHANCE TO
BOND WITH THEIR NEWBORN CHILD.

KNOW, SOME PEOPLE ARE TOO BUSY

UNSTEAD, THEY'RE FORCED TO GO TO

I'M SORRY.

STRAP ON.
STRAP ON, ERIC."

TRUMP MADE SURE TO INSIST THAT
THIS GOVERNMENT WILL STRICTLY
ENFORCE ITS SMALL-GOVERNMENT
STANCE.
>> WE ARE ALARMED BY THE NEW
CALLS TO ADOPT SOCIALISM IN OUR
COUNTRY.
( BOOING )
AMERICA WAS FOUNDED ON LIBERTY

HOW WILL WE BE REMEMBERED?

AND HE ENDED HIS SPEECH WITH
SOME LOFTY WORDS.

OUR SIGHTS ON THE BRIGHTEST

text:WE HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP.
WE REALLY DID.
WE HAD GOOD CHEMISTRY.
I WAS REALLY BEING TOUGH, AND SO
WAS HE.
AND WE WOULD GO BACK AND FORTH,
AND THEN WE FELL IN LOVE.
OKAY?

name:Stephen colbert

text:NO, REALLY.
WE FELL IN LOVE.
>> Stephen: YES, THEY COULDN'T
STAND EACH OTHER, AND NOW
THEY'RE IN LOVE.
IT'S ALL IN THE NEW ROM-COM,
"WHEN DONNY MET UNY."
 (  LAUGHTER  )
 ( APPLAUSE )

name:Stephen colbert

text: (AS TRUMP ): "I'LL NUKE WHAT HE
NUKING."
BUT NORTH KOREA HAS SOMETHING TO
OFFER OTHER THAN NUCLEAR
WEAPONS, BECAUSE THIS YEAR,
CRYSTAL METH IS NORTH KOREA'S
TRENDIEST LUNAR NEW YEAR'S GIFT.
AND WHEN YOUR NEW YEAR'S GIFT IS
METH, YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR
NEW YEAR'S REZ LUGE IS:  GIVE ME
MORE METH!

name:Stephen colbert

text:APPARENTLY, THIS IS TRUE, UP
UNTIL RECENTLY,
"METH HAS BEEN LARGELY SEEN
INSIDE NORTH KOREA AS A KIND OF
VERY POWERFUL ENERGY DRUG--
SOMETHING LIKE RED BULL,
AMPLIFIED."
YEAH, IT'S JUST LIKE RED BULL.
THAT EXPLAINS THE POPULARITY IN
NORTH KOREA OF "4000-HOUR ENERGY

name:Stephen colbert

text:DRINK."
SO FOR EVERYONE WORRIED THAT
NORTH KOREA HAS NUCLEAR WEAPONS,
JUST RELAX, OKAY.
THEY'RE ALSO METHED-UP TWEAKERS
WITH SPIDERS UNDER THEIR SKIN.
I'M SURE THEY WON'T FLY OFF THE
HANDLE.
BUT WHATEVER COMES OUT OF THE
HANOI SUMMIT, THERE'S ALREADY

name:Stephen colbert

text:ONE CLEAR WINNER AND THAT'S YOUR
HEAD.
BECAUSE A VIETNAMESE BARBER IS
GIVING OUT FREE TRUMP-KIM
HAIRCUTS-- WHICH I'M ASSUMING IS
EITHER KIM OR TRUMP, AND NOT
SOME FRANKENSTEIN OF THE TWO.
 (  LAUGHTER  )
THE HAIRCUTS ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY
STRAIGHTFORWARD.

name:Stephen colbert

text:FOR THE KIM, THE BARBER GIVES
YOU A SLICKED-BACK TOP AND
SHAVED SIDES.
AND FOR THE TRUMP, HE PULLS THE
MAJORITY OF YOUR HAIR OUT,
TRANSPLANTS DONOR HAIR FROM A
GOLDEN RETRIEVER'S BUTT, SWIRLS
IT AROUND LIKE SOFT SERVE, AND
JUST LOCKS IT IN PLACE WITH SOME
HOMER FORMBY QUICK-DRYING DECK

DISTURBING NEWS DAY IN AMERICA.
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" SUMMED IT
WITH THEIR NEW SLOGAN "ALL THE
NEWS THAT'S ICK TO PRINT."

text:THE ICKY STARTS WITH "EMPIRE"
ACTOR JUSSIE SMOLLETT, WHO WA
--
( AUDIENCE REACTS )
-- I FEEL THE SAME WAY -- WHO
WAS
TAKEN INTO CUSTODY TODAY FOR
FILING A FALSE REPORT, AFTER
POLICE DETERMINED THAT HE STAGED
A RACIST AND HOMOPHOBIC ATTACK
AGAINST HIMSELF LAST MONTH.

name:Stephen colbert

text:NOW, THIS STORY INVOLVES RACE,
SEXUALITY, POLITICS, AND
VIOLENCE.
SO, I NEED TO TREAD VERY LIGHTLY
HERE, AND SIMPLY SAY, WHAT A
(BLEEP)!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
JUST, OH!
NO!

name:Stephen colbert

text:JUST -- I'M SORRY.
I JUST -- COME ON!
SMOLLETT CAST HIMSELF AS A FAKE
NATIONAL SYMBOL OF OUR REAL
RACIAL AND POLITICAL DIVIDE WHEN
HE TOLD POLICE HE HAD BEEN
ATTACKED BY TWO MASKED MEN AT
THE ENTRANCE OF THE LOEWS HOTEL
IN CHICAGO.

name:Stephen colbert

text:HE CLAIMED THAT THEY YELLED
RACIST AND HOMOPHOBIC REMARKS
USED PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S
SIGNATURE SLOGAN, "MAKE AMERICA
GREAT AGAIN."
TIED A NOOSE AROUND HIS NECK AND
POURED BLEACH ON HIM, THEN FLED.
BUT POLICE SAY THAT SMOLLETT
ACTUALLY  HIRED TWO BROTHERS,
WHO ARE ALSO BLACK, TO CARRY OUT
THE SCHEME.

name:Stephen colbert

text:LOOK, I'M NOT AN EXPERT, BUT IF
YOU'RE GOING TO FAKE A WHITE
SUPREMACIST HATE CRIME, HIRE
WHITE GUYS!

MAYBE GUYS THAT DON'T LIVE IN
CHICAGO, TOO.

WHERE YOU DON'T WANT DIVERSITY.

I LIVED IN CHICAGO.
THEY HAVE WHITE MEN THERE.
GO TO A BLACKHAWKS GAME.

SMOLLETT ALSO, AND THIS IS A
CONSPIRACY NO-NO, PAID THE
BROTHERS BY CHECK!
( LAUGHTER )
COME ON.

name:Stephen colbert

text:AND IT DIDN'T HELP THAT HE WROTE
IN THE MEMO LINE "FOR FAKING
HATE CRIME AGAINST ME, JUSSIE
SMOLLETT, THE GUY FROM
'EMPIRE.'"
THIS WHOLE THING IS A HORRIBLE
AFFRONT TO ACTUAL VICTIMS OF
HATE CRIMES, DONE HORRIBLY.
( APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: YES, ABSOLUTELY.
>> Stephen: THERE'S NO GOOD
REASON TO TO SOMETHING LIKE

name:Stephen colbert

text:THIS, BUT
SMOLLETT HAD A PARTICULARLY BAD
ONE.
CHICAGO POLICE?
>> THIS STUNT WAS ORCHESTRATED
BY SMOLLETT BECAUSE HE WAS
DISSATISFIED WITH HIS SALARY.
>> STEPHEN: WHAT?!

name:Stephen colbert

text:HE STAGED A HATE CRIME TO BOOST
HIS CAREER?
THERE ARE LEGITIMATE WAYS TO DO
THAT.
HASN'T HE EVER HEARD OF A SEX
TAPE?
( LAUGHTER )
COME ON, A NIGHT VISION CAMERA

"SOMEHOW" IT LEAKS, BINGO,
YOU'RE HOSTING "THE LATE SHOW."

(AS TRUMP)
"AFTER ALL, RACIST AND DANGEROUS
COMMENTS, KIND OF MY THING.
NEVER RUB ANOTHER MAN'S
RHUBARB."

text:( APPLAUSE )
THAT'S TRUE.
>> Jon: I WON'T BE TOUCHING NO
RHUBARB.
>> Stephen: BUT SMOLLETT ISN'T
THE ONLY ICKY NEWS TODAY.
LAST NIGHT, WE FOUND OUT THAT
THE F.B.I. HAS ARRESTED A COAST
GUARD OFFICER WHO WAS PLANNING A
RAMPAGE AGAINST DEMOCRATS AND
JOURNALISTS.

name:Stephen colbert

text:WHEN THEY RAIDED HIS APARTMENT
THEY FOUND A HUGE CACHE OF

LOOK AT HOW NEAT THAT IS.

WHO SAYS MEN DON'T LIKE MARIE
KONDO?
( LAUGHTER )
"THIS GRENADE SPARKS JOY IN ME

name:Stephen colbert

text:( LAUGHTER )
ALSO, IT WILL SPARK A FIRE.
IT'S INCENDIARY."
THE OFFICER IN QUESTION,
CHRISTOPHER P. HASSON, ONCE
WROTE IN A LETTER "I AM A LONG
TIME WHITE NATIONALIST, HAVING
BEEN A SKINHEAD 30 PLUS YEARS."
30 YEARS?

name:Stephen colbert

text:THAT IS A LONG TIME.
HE IS CLOSE TO SKINHEAD
RETIREMENT.
SOON HE CAN CASH IN HIS 401KKK
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
THAT GOT A BETTER RESPONSE THAN
I THOUGHT.
>> Jon: I LIKE.

name:Stephen colbert

text:THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
( APPLAUSE )
>> Stephen:.
>> Stephen: HASSON WAS
PLOTTING TO MURDER A
HUGE LIST OF PEOPLE, INCLUDING
POLITICIANS, JOURNALISTS
PROFESSORS, JUDGES AND OTHERS.
IN ONE LETTER HASSAN WROTE, "I
AM DREAMING OF A WAY TO KILL

text:ALMOST EVERY LAST PERSON ON THE
EARTH."
SORRY, BUT THE CHEESECAKE
FACTORY IS WAY AHEAD OF YOU.

THEY HAVE AN APPETIZER OF
CHEESEBURGERS.

SO THIS MAN IS A HOMICIDAL,
RACIST MONSTER, SERVING IN OUR
MILITARY, BUT DON'T WORRY, THE

name:Stephen colbert

text:COMMANDER IN CHIEF SLAPPED HIM
DOWN WITH THE SAVAGE TWEET OF:
NOTHING.
SILENCE.
MAKES SENSE.
HASSON ONLY WANTS TO KILL
EVERYONE ON EARTH.
IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S HOSTING
"SNL."

name:Stephen colbert

text:PLUS, TRUMP COULDN'T TWEET ABOUT
IT.
HE WAS TOO BUSY DENOUNCING BAD
CELL PHONE SERVICE.
(AS TRUMP)
"I WANT 5G, AND EVEN 6G,
TECHNOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
IT IS FAR MORE POWERFUL, FASTER,
AND SMARTER THAN THE CURRENT
STANDARD."

TO THE WHITE HOUSE WIFI.
(AS TRUMP)
"I'VE GOT MY PHONE HERE, BUT NO

SOMEONE HELP ME FIND THE
G-SPOT."
"I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE --
THERE'S FIVE OF THEM.

name:Stephen colbert

text:I HEAR THERE'S FIVE ."
( PIANO RIFF )
NOW, IT'S POSSIBLE THAT TRUMP
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING
ABOUT HERE BECAUSE 6G TECHNOLOGY
DOESN'T EXIST.
HE THINKS 6G IS YOUR OPENING
OFFER TO SILENCE A PORN STAR.
(AS TRUMP)
"OKAY, OKAY, I UNDERSTAND.

THERE'S NOTHING CERTAIN ABOUT

YESTERDAY, I WAS CONFIDENT THAT
AMERICA WOULD STILL HAVE A

WEDGE WE HAVE IN THE WHITE
HOUSE.
I SAY WEDGE BECAUSE HE'S THE
SIMPLEST OF TOOLS.

THANK YOU.
HERE'S THE SITUATION -- BASED ON
SIGNALS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE,

name:Stephen colbert

text:LAST NIGHT, MITCH MCCONNELL
PASSED A SHORT-TERM SPENDING
BILL THAT WOULD KEEP THE
GOVERNMENT OPEN TILL FEBRUARY.
100 TO NOTHING.
NOW, IT DIDN'T INCLUDE THE $5
BILLION THAT TRUMP WANTED FOR
HIS BORDER WALL, BUT
EVERYBODY-- EVEN MCCONNELL--
THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO SIGN IT,
BECAUSE SARAH HUCKA-SANDS

name:Stephen colbert

text:TOLD FOX NEWS, "WE HAVE OTHER
WAYS THAT WE CAN GET TO THAT
$5 BILLION."
THAT'S PUTTING A LOT OF PRESSURE
ON ERIC AND DON JR'S LEMONADE

LOVELY.

name:Stephen colbert

text:>> YOU BOYS NEED TO SELL THAT
OLD LEMONADE.

BUT THEN, TRUMP STARTED GETTING
HEAT FROM THE FOURTH BRANCH OF
GOVERNMENT: FOX NEWS.
>> YOU TOLD US THAT YOU WEREN'T
AFRAID TO SHUTDOWN THE
GOVERNMENT.

name:Stephen colbert

text:THAT'S WHY WE LIKE YOU.
WHAT HAPPENED?
YOU JUST GAVE IN RIGHT AWAY?

DEMOCRATS GET EVERYTHING.

THIS WAS A BLINK.

YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FOLLOW

I'M SORRY, TV.
PLEASE FORGIVE ME, YOU'RE MY
ONLY FRIEND!"

>> Jon: WOW.
>> Stephen: THE TV'S THE ONLY
ONE WHO'S SEEN ME NAKED.
( LAUGHTER )
( PIANO RIFF )
SO, THIS MORNING, SUDDENLY TRUMP
WAS ANGRY, TWEETING ABOUT THE
LAST BIG SPENDING BILL HE
SIGNED --
"WHEN I BEGRUDGINGLY SIGNED THE
OMNIBUS BILL, I WAS PROMISED THE

name:Stephen colbert

text:WALL AND BORDER SECURITY BY
LEADERSHIP.
WOULD BE DONE BY END OF YEAR--

WANTED.

CAMPAIGN THEME SONG THAT HAD
PREPARED HIM FOR THIS MOMENT --

name:Stephen colbert

text:>> Stephen: NOW, THANK YOU,
MICKEY BAD BOY!
WHOO!
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> Jon: YEAH!
>> STEPHEN: TRUMP'S SEEMING
INDECISION CAUSED MASSIVE PANIC
AMONG REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE,
WHO WONDERED, IF THEY VOTED ON A
SEPARATE BILL TO FUND THE WALL,
WOULD THAT PLACATE THE

name:Stephen colbert

text:PRESIDENT?
AS ONE REPORTER DESCRIBED IT --
REPUBLICANS SAY THEY WANT
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO TWEET BEFORE
THEY SAY "YES."
WITH ONE G.O.P. MEMBER SAYING,
"THAT'S WHAT THE (BLEEP) SERVING
IN CONGRESS HAS COME TO."
( APPLAUSE )
WAITING FOR TRUMP TO TWEET SO

name:Stephen colbert

text:YOU CAN FIND OUT WHAT YOUR JOB
IS THAT DAY?
THAT'S ALSO WHAT THE (BLEEP)
HOSTING A TALK SHOW HAS COME
TO.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
( PIANO RIFF )
THEN, THIS AFTERNOON, TRUMP HAD
A MEETING WITH PAUL RYAN AND
HOUSE REPUBLICANS, AND
AFTERWARDS, RYAN ANNOUNCED THAT

text:TRUMP WOULDN'T SIGN THE SPENDING
BILL.
ADDING, "I'M REALLY ENJOYING MY
LAST FEW HOURS IN CONGRESS!"

TRUMP WASN'T EVEN ANGRY.
DURING THAT MEETING, REPUBLICAN
REPRESENTATIVE MARK WALKER
DESCRIBED TRUMP'S MOOD AS
"CHIPPER."
AS IN --
(AS TRUMP) "I DECIDED TO THROW

SO, THERE IT IS, EVERYBODY IN
WASHINGTON IS HEADED HOME FOR
THE HOLIDAYS, WHEN DONALD TRUMP
DECIDES TO DROP A STEAMING YULE
LOG INTO THE NOG.
ALL FOR THE WALL.
AND REPUBLICANS WERE NOT AMUSED.

text:TAKE, FOR INSTANCE, MAINE
SENATOR AND PORTLAND'S NUMBER
ONE REALTOR FIVE YEARS IN A ROW,
SUSAN COLLINS.
A REPORTER DESCRIBED HER
REACTION TO THE NEWS THIS WAY:
"COLLINS ALMOST DROPPED HER
HANDBAG AS SHE GESTURED IN
DISBELIEF AT WORD, DELIVERED TO
HER BY REPORTERS, THAT TRUMP
WOULD NOT SIGN THE CONTINUING
RESOLUTION UNLESS BORDER WALL

ASKING, 'DID HE JUST SAY THAT?
UGH, ARE YOU RUINING MY LIFE?'"

GOING TO HAVE A LONG MEETING
WITH HER BROTHER TOM.

BUT THE NEWS DIDN'T SEEM TO

GOING TO BE A NEW VOTE.
"I SAW SENATORS HEADING OUT
GOING HOME."
YES, I CAN TELL YOU WITH
CERTAINTY THAT ALL 100 SENATORS

name:Stephen colbert

text:ARE NOT GOING TO BE VOTING
TONIGHT BECAUSE ONE OF THEM IS
IN MY GREEN ROOM.
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
BY THE WAY, THAT SMILE AND THAT
WAVE IS JEFF FLAKE'S VERSION OF
FLIPPING THE BIRD.
( LAUGHTER )
THAT'S AS ANGRY AS HE GETS!
THE CRAZINESS WENT ON --
"THEN TED CRUZ WALKED BY CORKER

name:Stephen colbert

text:AND SAID, 'I THINK WE NEED TO
FOLLOW THROUGH WITH FUNDING FOR
THE BORDER.'
CORKER LAUGHED AGAIN.
'YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS STUFF UP.'"
SO WHAT'S THE END GAME HERE?
TRUMP HAS SAID HE WON'T SIGN
ANYTHING WITHOUT THE WALL AND
NANCY PELOSI SAYS IT'S NEVER
GOING TO HAPPEN.
SEEMS LIKE THERE'S NO ANSWER,
BUT STUPID GUY HAS VERY STUPID

"YES, YES, STEEL SLATS.

AND THE ONLY WAY THIS WON'T FOOL
DEMOCRATIC VOTERS IS IF I SAY
THIS PLAN OUT LOUD ON
TELEVISION.

( LAUGHTER )
NOW, HE'S BEEN TRYING TO FLOAT
THIS IDEA FOR DAYS, MUCH LIKE
THAT YULE LOG.

ON TUESDAY, TWEETING THE WALL
WILL ACTUALLY BE "ARTISTICALLY

THE BAD NEWS: THE WASHINGTON

HIGHLY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION TO
THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER AND

name:Stephen colbert

GOOD NEWS:
TRUMP FOUND THE LEAKER.

HERE'S THE DEAL.

THAT HIS NAME -- IN THE OVAL

name:Stephen colbert

text:OFFICE LAST WEEK, TRUMP
APPARENTLY WENT OFF

THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE.
TRUMP HAS A SCRIPT?
( LAUGHTER )
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT FOR A

name:Stephen colbert

text:MINUTE.
I NEED INTEL ON THAT.
>> YEAH, I NEED THAT, TOO.
>> Stephen: THE INFORMATION IS
SO SENSITIVE,
THE ARTICLE CAN'T DESCRIBE IN
DETAIL WHAT WAS SHARED, BUT
ONE OFFICIAL SAID, "THIS IS
CODE-WORD INFORMATION."

name:Stephen colbert

text:"CODE WORD" MEANS LIKE THE VITAL
ASPECTS OF THE STORY HAVE TO BE
REPLACED WITH OTHER WORDS.
YOU HAVE TO SAY THINGS LIKE
"THE PACKAGE HAS BEEN
DELIVERED."
"THE SQUIRREL IS IN THE BASKET."
"THE IDIOT IS IN THE OVAL."

name:Stephen colbert

text:( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
IT COULD MEAN ANYTHING.
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
>> Jon: YEAH, YEAH.
>> Stephen: I'M GUESSING WE'RE
GOING TO HAVE A LOT MORE ON THAT

name:Stephen colbert

text:STORY TOMORROW.
BUT THE OTHER BIG STORY
CONTINUES TO BE TRUMP'S FIRING
OF F.B.I. DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY.
EVERY DAY, WE LEARN MORE AND
UNDERSTAND LESS.
RIGHT NOW, EVERYONE'S BUZZING
ABOUT A DINNER THE TWO SHARED
SHORTLY AFTER THE INAUGURATION,
WHEN TRUMP ASKED COMEY TO PLEDGE

name:Stephen colbert

text:HIS LOYALTY TO HIM.
"JAMES, I THOUGHT WE'D START
WITH A CAESAR SALAD, THEN THE
FLANK STEAK, THEN, FOR DESSERT,
TWO DELICIOUS SCOOPS OF
UNDERMINING THE INTEGRITY OF THE
F.B.I."
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
PEOPLE CLOSE TO COMEY SAY HE
REFUSED TO PLEDGE HIS LOYALTY

name:Stephen colbert

text:BUT, INSTEAD, PROMISED THE
PRESIDENT HIS HONESTY.
BUT TRUMP PRESSED ON, ASKING FOR
COMEY'S, "HONEST LOYALTY."
THAT'S THE ART OF THE DEAL.
"OKAY.
I WANT LOYALTY, YOU WANT
HONESTY.
LET'S MEET IN THE MIDDLE AT
"LOYESTY."

name:Stephen colbert

text:( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
BUT THIS WEEKEND TRUMP CLEARED
THE WHOLE THING UP ON FOX NEWS.
>> PEOPLE SUGGEST THAT THE
QUESTION, APPARENTLY, THE "NEW
YORK TIMES" IS SELLING, THAT YOU
ASKED COMEY WHETHER OR NOT YOU
HAD HIS LOYALTY WAS POSSIBLY
INAPPROPRIATE.
COULD YOU SEE HOW--
>> NO I DON'T THINK, I READ THAT

name:Stephen colbert

text:ARTICLE.
I DON'T THINK IT'S
INAPPROPRIATE, NUMBER ONE--
>> DID YOU ASK THAT QUESTION?
>> NO, NO, I DIDN'T, BUT I DON'T
THINK IT WOULD BE A BAD
QUESTION TO ASK.
>> STEPHEN: "YOUR HONOR, I DID
NOT BURN DOWN THAT HOSPITAL, BUT

HOSPITAL TO BURN DOWN.
( LAUGHTER )
IT LOOKS PERFECTLY FLAMMABLE AND
MY FRIENDS, THE FLAMES, WOULD
DANCE FOR ME."
( LAUGHTER )
( PIANO RIFF )
( APPLAUSE )
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT GOT SAID AT
THE DINNER, BUT TRUMP CLAIMS
COMEY ALSO SAID TRUMP WASN'T

name:Stephen colbert

text:UNDER INVESTIGATION.
AND TO MAKE SURE COMEY ZIPS THE
OLD TOOTH PURSE, TRUMP TWEETED
THIS THREAT ON FRIDAY:
"JAMES COMEY BETTER HOPE THAT
THERE ARE NO "TAPES" OF OUR
CONVERSATIONS BEFORE HE STARTS
LEAKING TO THE PRESS!"
THAT WOULD BE HUGE.
IT WOULD BE THE FIRST TIME A
LEAKED TAPE EVER MADE DONALD

name:Stephen colbert

text:TRUMP LOOK GOOD.
( LAUGHTER )
NOBODY KNOWS HOW WIDESPREAD THIS
ALLEGED TAPING IS.
IS HE RECORDING STAFF MEMBERS?
VISITING HEADS OF STATE?
IS THERE A BOOTLEG OF TED NUGENT
LIVE IN THE OVAL OFFICE?

name:Stephen colbert

text:( LAUGHTER )
I'D BUY THAT.
>> Jon: THAT WOULD BE NICE.
HE MIGHT SOUND GOOD ON THAT.
I'M INTERESTED.
>> Stephen: WANGO TANGO!
( APPLAUSE )
AND WHILE IT'S AN INSANE THING

name:Stephen colbert

text:FOR THE PRESIDENT TO THREATEN,
IT'S CRAZIER THAT WE DON'T KNOW
IF IT REALLY HAPPENED.
ON FRIDAY, SEAN SPICER WAS ASKED
A SIMPLE YES OR NO QUESTION: IS
THE PRESIDENT RECORDING HIS
CONVERSATIONS?
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS NOTHING
FURTHER TO ADD ON THAT.
>> WHY DID HE SAY THAT?

name:Stephen colbert

text:WHY DID HE TWEET THAT?
WHAT SHOULD WE INTERPRET FROM
THAT?
>> AS I MENTIONED, THE PRESIDENT
HAS NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD ON
THAT.
>> ARE THERE RECORDING DEVICES
IN THE OVAL OFFICE OR IN THE
RESIDENCE?

name:Stephen colbert

text:>> AS I'VE SAID FOR THE THIRD
TIME, THERE IS NOTHING FURTHER
TO ADD ON THAT.
>> DOES HE THINK IT'S
APPROPRIATE TO THREATEN SOMEONE
LIKE MR. COMEY NOT TO SPEAK?
>> I DON'T THINK-- THAT'S,
THAT'S NOT A THREAT.
HE SIMPLY STATED A FACT.

name:Stephen colbert

text:THE TWEET SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.
I'M MOVING ON.
>> STEPHEN: IT'S A GOOD THING
THAT TWEET SPEAKS FOR ITSELF
BECAUSE SEAN SPICER CERTAINLY
DOESN'T.
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
MOVING ON.

name:Stephen colbert

text:( PIANO RIFF )
WELL, FOR SOME REASON, THE PRESS
CORPS JUST WOULDN'T TAKE "NO
ANSWER" FOR AN ANSWER, AND TODAY
SOMEONE ASKED SPICER ABOUT
POTENTIAL CONGRESSIONAL
SUBPEONAS.
>> I THINK I MADE IT CLEAR LAST
WEEK THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS
NOTHING FURTHER ON THAT,
HUNTER.

name:Stephen colbert

text:>> WAIT, WAIT, SEAN, DOES THAT
MEAN THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL
DENY THE REQUESTS?
>> I THINK, I SAID, I WAS
VERY CLEAR THAT WE -- THE
PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE NOTHING
FURTHER ON THAT LAST WEEK.
>> YOU'RE DESCRIBING A SITUATION
IN WHICH THE PRESIDENT WOULD
DEFY THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH'S
REQUEST, THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

text:SAYING.
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT.
ALEXIS, I MADE IT CLEAR WHAT THE
PRESIDENT'S POSITION IS ON THAT
ISSUE.

SOMETHING HAPPENED THREE DAYS
AGO DOESN'T MEAN REPORTERS
AREN'T ALLOWED TO KEEP TALKING

text:ABOUT IT.
I MEAN, BACHELOR COUPLE BEN AND
LAUREN JUST BROKE UP TODAY, AND
I'M GOING TO BE PROCESSING THAT

WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE
RECORDINGS?

text:>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS
MADE IT CLEAR WHAT HIS POSITION
IS.
>> THAT'S NOT MY QUESTION.
SO WHY WON'T YOU EXPLAIN?
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT
THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT'S
POSITION IS.

text:>> SO, GIVEN YOU REFUSE TO
CONFIRM OR DENY ANY OF THIS, HOW
IS ANY SENIOR OFFICIAL SUPPOSED
TO FEEL COMFORTABLE HAVING A
CONVERSATION PRIVATELY WITH THE

IF YOU WATCH THIS SHOW, WE DID
THE PRESIDENT ABOUT BEING A
TERRIBLE PERSON, BUT IN REALITY
IT IS MUCH WORSE THAN WE COULD

CONSTRUCTION OF TRUMP TOWER, HE
WAS INSPECTING THE ELEVATORS AND
TRUMP LOOKED AT THE PANELS WHERE
THE BUTTONS YOU PUSH TO REACH A
FLOOR WERE LOCATED.
HE NOTICED THAT NEXT TO EACH
NUMBER WERE SOME LITTLE DOTS.

text:"WHAT'S THIS?" TRUMP ASKED.
"BRAILLE," THE ARCHITECT
REPLIED.
YOU'D THINK TRUMP WOULD LOVE
BRAILLE-- IT'S LIKE READING
THROUGH GROPING!
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )
"OH, OH, OH, YEAH -- I LIKE, I
LIKE."

BUT HE TOLD THE ARCHITECT TO GET
RID OF IT.

OF THE --EXPLETIVE-- BRAILLE.
NO BLIND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO
LIVE IN TRUMP TOWER!"

DECORATED IT.

I LOVE THE CHEERING, BUT I WAS
BEING THE BLIND DECORATOR
HEARING THE DECOR.
( LAUGHTER )
ACCORDING TO REZ, TRUMP KNEW

name:Stephen colbert

text:THAT THE ARCHITECT COULDN'T
ACTUALLY TAKE THE BRAILLE
OFF, BUT ORDERING AN UNDERLING
TO DO SOMETHING THAT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE GAVE TRUMP THE
OPPORTUNITY TO YELL AT THEM AND
ALSO BLAME THEM FOR ANYTHING
THAT WENT WRONG LATER.
SHE CALLED IT, "A TRUMP-STYLE
WIN-WIN."
AS OPPOSED TO A TRUMP STYLE
LOSE-WIN, WHICH IS HOW HE BECAME

name:Stephen colbert

text:PRESIDENT.
( APPLAUSE )
YEAH, SOME ELECTORAL COLLEGE
FANS.
NOT ONLY THAT, TRUMP ASKED HIS
WORKERS TO LIE IN ORDER TO SELL
MORE APARTMENTS, LIKE SAYING
THAT THE MARBLE IN THE BATHROOM
WAS LUXURIOUS, WHEN THEY KNEW IT
WAS MADE WITH CRUSHED MARBLE AND

COUNTING HIS ACCUSERS, BRETT
KAVANAUGH.

LET ME-- LET ME-- LET ME DO THIS
QUICKLY AS I CAN, BECAUSE IT'S
IMPORTANT.
BUT WE HAVE TO GET TO THE
PRESIDENT'S PRESS
CONFERENCE, BECAUSE IT'S
UNBELIEVABLE.

name:Stephen colbert

text:THIS MORNING, WE LEARNED NEW
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST KAVANAUGH
FROM A WOMAN NAMED JULIE
SWETNICK, AND SHE SAYS THAT BACK
IN HIGH SCHOOL, SHE "ATTENDED
"WELL OVER TEN" PARTIES WHERE
KAVANAUGH WAS PRESENT AND SAW
HIM "DRINK EXCESSIVELY AT MANY
OF THESE PARTIES AND ENGAGE IN
ABUSIVE AND PHYSICALLY
AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR TOWARDS
GIRLS."

text:NOW, DO WE WANT SOMEONE ON THE
SUPREME COURT WHO TREATED WOMEN
THIS WAY, EVEN IN HIGH SCHOOL?

>> Stephen: I'M NOT SURE WE
EVEN WANT SOMEONE WHO EVEN
ATTENDED 10 PARTIES IN HIGH
SCHOOL.
WE WANT NERDS, DAMMIT!

name:Stephen colbert

text:BUT FROM THERE--
 ( APPLAUSE )
FROM THERE--
 ( APPLAUSE )
I GOTTA WARN YOU, I GOTTA WARN
YOU, SINCERELY, FROM THERE HER
STATEMENT GETS EXTREMELY DARK.
SHE SAYS THAT SHE WITNESSED
KAVANAUGH AND HIS FRIEND, MARK
JUDGE, DOSE THE PUNCH AT
MULTIPLE PARTIES WITH WHAT SHE

name:Stephen colbert

text:SUSPECTS WAS GRAIN ALCOHOL AND
QUALUUDES, SO THAT THE GIRLS
COULD BE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY
MULTIPLE BOYS.
AND SHE SAYS THAT "IN
APPROXIMATELY 1982, I BECAME THE
VICTIM."
ALL OF THAT IS, OF COURSE,
HORRIFYING TO CONTEMPLATE.
KAVANAUGH HAS RESPONDED TO THE
ALLEGATIONS IN A STATEMENT,

name:Stephen colbert

text:SAYING, "THIS IS RIDICULOUS AND
FROM THE TWILIGHT ZONE, AND I
DON'T KNOW WHO THIS IS.
>> 
FIRST OF ALL, LET'S NOT MALIGN
THE GOOD NAME OF "THE TWILIGHT
ZONE"!
AVAILABLE NOW ON CBS ALL ACCESS!
$9.99 A MONTH, NO COMMERCIALS.

name:Stephen colbert

text:SECOND, HE MIGHT CLAIM TO NOT
KNOW HER, BUT SHE SEEMS TO KNOW
HIM.
IN HER STATEMENT, SWETNICK SAYS
SHE "ALSO WITNESSED SUCH CONDUCT
ON ONE OCCASION IN OCEAN CITY,
MARYLAND, DURING 'BEACH WEEK.'"
NOW, WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THERE
WAS SOMETHING CALLED "BEACH
WEEK."

name:Stephen colbert

text:I SUPPOSE WE COULD LOOK AT THE
1982 CALENDAR KAVANAUGH
SMITTY TO SEE-- OKAY, THERE YOU
GO.
THERE IS-- WOW, WOW, AIN'T THAT
A BEACH.
SO SWETNICK MADE THIS SWORN
STATEMENT UNDER PENALTY OF
PERJURY.
KAVANAUGH, ON THE OTHER HAND,
CATEGORICALLY DENIES IT, AND

name:Stephen colbert

text:MANY OF HIS FRIENDS SAY THEY
HAVE NO IDEA WHO THIS WOMAN IS.
HOW DO YOU KNOW THE TRUTH?
IF ONLY THERE WAS SOME BUREAU ON
THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT COULD
INVESTIGATE THINGS.
A B.F.I., IF YOU WILL.
( LAUGHTER )
BY THE WAY, THE NEW HIT DRAMA,

name:Stephen colbert

text:"F.B.I.," ALSO AVAILABLE ON CBS
ALL ACCESS, FROM EXECUTIVE
PRODUCER, WOLF DICK.
( APPLAUSE )
SO IT WAS AGAINST THIS BACKDROP
THAT THE PRESIDENT DECIDED TO
CALL ONLY HIS FOURTH PRESS
CONFERENCE SINCE BECOMING
PRESIDENT THIS AFTERNOON.
IN FACT, WHEN I WALKED OUT HERE
TO DO THIS, IT WAS STILL GOING

name:Stephen colbert

text:ON.
HE WAS STILL TAKING QUESTIONS AS
I WALKED ON STAGE.
HE STARTED BY DEFENDING WHY HE
DIDN'T CALL FOR AN F.B.I.
INVESTIGATION INTO THE ACCUSERS'
CLAIMS.
>> THE F.B.I. TOLD US THEY'VE
INVESTIGATED JUDGE KAVANAUGH SIX
TIMES, FIVE TIMES-- MANY TIMES
OVER THE YEARS.

name:Stephen colbert

text:THEY KNOW HIM VERY WELL.
BUT HERE THERE WAS NOTHING TO
INVESTIGATE FROM AT LEAST ONE
STANDPOINT.
THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE LOCATION.
THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE TIME.
THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE YEAR.

name:Stephen colbert

text:THEY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING.
AND IT'S LIKE WHERE DO YOU GO?
>> Stephen: YEAH.
WHERE DO YOU GO?
OTHER THAN TO ASK PEOPLE
QUESTIONS.
( LAUGHTER )
I'D LOVE TO SEE HOW DONALD TRUMP

name:Stephen colbert

text:PLAYS REQUESTED CLUE."
"WHO KILLED MR. BODY?
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW,
UNLESS WE OPEN THAT TINY

FIVE, MAYBE SIX TIMES BEFORE."
THEN, THEN TRUMP--
 ( APPLAUSE )

name:Stephen colbert

text:"CLUE" FANS.
BIG FANS OF COLONEL MUSTARD HERE
TONIGHT.
( LAUGHTER )
THEN TRUMP SUMMED UP HIS
FEELINGS ABOUT THESE
ALLEGATIONS.
>> A BIG, FAT CON JOB.
>> Stephen: THAT IS A HARSH
ATTACK ON THESE WOMEN, BUT

name:Stephen colbert

text:IT WOULD MAKE AN HONEST SLOGAN:
"TRUMP 2020: A BIG FAT CON JOB."
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
239.
TECHNICALLY, A 239-POUND CON
JOB.
(  LAUGHTER  )
HE WENT ON TO EXPLAIN THAT, JUST
LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE, THIS IS
ALL A CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM.
>> I THINK WHEN YOU REALLY LOOK
AT IT ALL, IT'S NOT GOING TO

name:Stephen colbert

text:CHANGE ANY OF THE DEMOCRATS'
MINDS.
THEY'RE OBSTRUCTIONISTS.
AND THEY GO INTO A ROOM, AND I
GUARANTEE YOU THEY LAUGH LIKE
HELL AT WHAT THEY PULLED OFF ON
YOU AND ON THE PUBLIC.
THEY LAUGH LIKE HELL.
>> Stephen: "THEY LAUGH LIKE
HELL... NOT AS LOUD AS THE U.N.

name:Stephen colbert

text:LAUGHED AT ME, BUT STILL, PRETTY
LOUD.
HELLO.
IS THIS ON?
HELLO."
( APPLAUSE )
 (  LAUGHTER  )
AND WHEN FAKE NEWS CNN'S JIM
ACOSTA GOT A CHANCE TO ASK A

name:Stephen colbert

text:QUESTION, HE MADE A SUGGESTION
TO THE PRESIDENT.
>> IF YOU DON'T MIND, AFTER I'M
FINISHED, IF WEIJIA OR HALLIE OR
VIVIAN, OR ONE OF OUR FEMALE
COLLEAGUES COULD GO AFTER ME,
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
MR. PRESIDENT, JUST TO FOLLOW UP
ON THESE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST
BRETT KAVANAUGH--
>> WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY THAT?

name:Stephen colbert

text:EXPLAIN.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
>> I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT IF
A FEMALE--
>> NO, WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
>> IT'D BE GREAT IF A FEMALE
REPORTER COULD ASK A QUESTION
ABOUT THIS ISSUE.

name:Stephen colbert

text:SO IF YOU DON'T MIND.
>> I WOULDN'T MIND THAT AT ALL.
WOULDN'T MIND AT ALL.
WOULDN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO
ME.
GO AHEAD.

WOMAN, ANIMAL, DOESN'T MAKE ANY

text:DIFFERENCE TO ME.
I WILL ANSWER ALL YOUR QUESTIONS
IN A BONE-CHILLING RAMBLE."
(  LAUGHTER  )

text:THEN THE PRESIDENT WARNED
AMERICA THAT #METOO IS AN
INSATIABLE CARNIVOROUS BEAST
THAT IS COMING FOR EVERYONE.

SCARED, BECAUSE WE COULD SAY IT
ABOUT YOU-- 35 YEARS AGO YOU--
AND YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON.
WHAT IS GOING ON?

name:Stephen colbert

text:YOU KNOW, IT CAN HAPPEN THE
OTHER WAY.
ALLEGATIONS CAN GO THE OTHER
WAY, ALSO.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT.
I COULD PICK A WOMAN, AND SHE
COULD HAVE CHARGES MADE FROM
MANY YEARS AGO, ALSO.

REALLY, AT THIS POINT, PRETTY

AGAINST THEM."
(  LAUGHTER  )
"SO, YOU KNOW.
ARE YOU A COP?
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME IF YOU'RE A

( APPLAUSE )
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE
KAVANAUGH HEARING TOMORROW,
TRUMP WANTS YOU TO KNOW HE'LL

name:Stephen colbert

text:BE ALL OVER IT.
>> I'M GONNA BE WATCHING,
YOU KNOW, BELIEVE IT OR NOT.
>> Stephen: SIR, IT IS HARD TO
BELIEVE YOU DO ANYTHING BUT
WATCH TV.
AND-- AND--
 ( APPLAUSE )
AND HE PUT THIS HEARING IN
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE.

text:>> LOOK, IF WE BROUGHT

SAID, "WE HAVE GEORGE

THINK, ACCUSATIONS MADE.

text:HE OWNED SLAVES.
(  LAUGHTER  )
BUT TRUMP KNOWS WHAT THESE WOMEN

REPORT IT.
BECAUSE, IN SOME INSTANCES,
PEOPLE KEEP IT QUIET.
IT'S A VERY TOUGH SITUATION FOR
A WOMAN.

name:Stephen colbert

text:THERE'S NO QUESTION.
>> Stephen (AS TRUMP): "AND I
SHOULD KNOW.
I HAVE PUT WOMEN IN THAT
SITUATION A LOT.
OKAY.
I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT."

ONE REPORTER TRIED TO GET A

ANOTHER CANDIDATE TRUMP'S TEAM
IS WATCHING IS NEW JERSEY
SENATOR AND MAN WHO IS ABOUT
THIS TALL, CORY BOOKER.
BUT HIS PRESIDENTIAL BID HAS HIT
A ROUGH PATCH IN HIS HOME STATE.
JUST LIKE FORMER GOVERNOR CHRIS
CHRISTIE, BOOKER'S APPROVAL

text:RATINGS HAVE SLIPPED SINCE HE
LAUNCHED HIS PRESIDENTIAL BID,
WHICH IS BEING CALLED THE
"CHRISTIE EFFECT."
TURNS OUT, PEOPLE IN NEW JERSEY
DON'T LIKE IT WHEN YOU TRY TO
LEAVE THEM AND RUN FOR HIGHER
OFFICE, WHICH EXPLAINS THEIR
STATE MOTTO: "WHAT, YOU THINK
YOU'RE BETTER THAN ME?"

 ( APPLAUSE )

name:Stephen colbert

text:YEAH.
>> Jon: YOU BETTER HOLD ON TO
WHAT WE'VE GOT!
>> Stephen: SOUNDS BETTER IN
LATIN.
>> Jon: DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
IF YOU MAKE IT OR NOT.

ALSO KEEPING AN EYE ON
CALIFORNIA SENATOR KAMALA
HARRIS.

name:Stephen colbert

text:THEY WERE IMPRESSED BY HARRIS'S
CAMPAIGN LAUNCH, WHERE SHE SPOKE
TO AN ESTIMATED 20,000 PEOPLE.
THAT BIG CROWD DREW THE NOTICE
OF THE RALLY-OBSESSED TRUMP
TEAM.
BIG, ENTHUSIASTIC CROWDS
FRIGHTEN THE TRUMP TEAM.
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE ALSO VERY
WORRIED ABOUT A PRESIDENTIAL BID

text:BY SENATOR "GRAVEDIGGER"!
HIS FOREIGN POLICY IS
SURPRISINGLY NUANCED, NUANCED,
NUANCED!

 ( APPLAUSE ).
>> Stephen: AND SENATOR
HARRIS'-- A LOT OF GRAVEDIGGER
FANS HERE TONIGHT.

name:Stephen colbert

text:AND SENATOR HARRIS'S APPEAL
COULD ONLY BE GROWING, BECAUSE
EARLIER THIS WEEK, SHE CALLED
FOR MARIJUANA LEGALIZATION.
AND THAT IS--
 ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I BELIEVE-- I BELIEVE THAT CHEER
IS WHY SHE DID IT.
HARRIS HAS ALSO COME OUT
STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF BIRTHDAYS,
SEX, AND YOU-- THE GREATEST
AUDIENCE IN THE WORLD!

name:Stephen colbert

text: ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
YEAH.
MARIJUANA CAN'T GET YOU THAT
HIGH.
NOW, HARRIS EXPLAINED HE
HISTORY WITH WEED BACK WHEN SHE
WAS IN COLLEGE,
DURING AN APPEARANCE ON "THE
BREAKFAST CLUB," TALKING WITH
OUR FRIEND CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD,
WHO IS NEVER AFRAID TO ASK THE
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS.

WHAT WAS ON?

DEFINITELY SNOOP, TUPAC FOR

SENSE.

text:WE ALSO WOULD HAVE ACCEPTED
PHISH, CYPRESS HILL, OR THE
SOUND OF THE CLOCK, WHICH IS
REALLY LOUD.
HAS IT ALWAYS BEEN THAT LOUD?
 (  LAUGHTER  )
SO, IT SEEMS LIKE A SIMPLE
STORY: KAMALA HARRIS SMOKED WEED
IN COLLEGE WHILE LISTENING TO
SNOOP AND TUPAC.

name:Stephen colbert

text:BUT THE SLEUTHS OVER AT "FOX &
FRIENDS" WEREN'T BUYING IT.
>> SHE GRADUATED FROM COLLEGE AT
HOWARD IN 1986.
SHE FINISHED LAW SCHOOL IN 1989.
SHE WAS ADMITTED TO THE STATE
BAR OF CALIFORNIA IN 1990.
AND THEN, IN 1991, TUPAC'S FIRST
ALBUM CAME OUT.
AND IN 1993, SNOOP DOGG'S FIRST
ALBUM WAS RELEASED.

text:SO THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE
TIMELINE.

BUT EVEN IF THIS IS OBVIOUS,
IT'S STILL A BIG DEAL.

THEN IT WAS, "OKAY, THEY DID,
BUT IT WAS JUST ABOUT
ADOPTIONS."

MEETING WITH ROUGHLY THE SAME
GROUP OF PEOPLE, BUT NOT THE
PRESIDENT, DEFINITELY NOT THE

TALKING ABOUT THE STRATEGY OF
THE MEETING WITH THE RUSSIANS.

GIULIANI, MICHAEL COHEN SAYS
THAT TWO DAYS BEFORE THE TRUMP
TOWER MEETING WITH RUSSIANS,
THERE WAS A STRATEGY MEETING,
WHICH THEY PROBABLY SHOULD'VE
HAD BEFORE THEY HIRED RUDY
GIULIANI.

NOW, RUDY SEEMED TO REALIZE THAT
HE HAD MADE A LEGAL

FOX NEWS TO TRY TO EXPLAIN...
SOMETHING.

PRESIDENT WASN'T AT THE MEETING?
I UNDERSTAND THOSE TWO MEETINGS
THAT YOU JUST SET OUT THERE, BUT
THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN WHY YOU'RE
SAYING.
WHO ASKED IF HE WAS THERE?

TOOK PLACE AND WE ARE MAKING IT

DIDN'T HAPPEN.

WHICH MEANS IT HAPPENED AND HE
CALLED THE MEETING.

BUT WHY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
IT?

text:>> WE HEARD YOU SAY TODAY WAS
THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT AT THAT

a writer and contributor here until last
December when she left to go host her

Correspondents Dinner this personal
Javid White House press secretary Sarah

very resourceful like she burns facts
and then she uses that Ash to create a

okay to make cheap jokes about a woman's
appearance so incredibly disrespectful
it was shameful it was disgusting
thought the language was filthy it was
really over that's over the line x-rated

wasn't a single person on the dais that
interrupted that woman as filth was
coming out of her mouth yeah why didn't
someone stop that woman
like Michelle Rosa these people so hard

name:Michelle wolf

why isn't the Secret Service jumping in
front of those jokes
but it's not funny because Michelle
should have had the decency not to
comment on women's appearances in any

God's sake not the presidents Donald
Trump on the defense after attacking
Carly Fiorina

only an excuse when the insults are

that he wants to call Obama the founder
he is the founder of Isis I think the

knows the president is kidding president

So, basically, in what
it took me seven years to do,
you outdid me in three years.

-Yeah, you outdid me.
[ Cheers and applause ]
Well deserved.
-It's great.
Yeah, I think that --

about another photo.
This is afterwards.
This is a bunch of your writers.

"Lock her up!"

Obviously, you had --
This blows my mind,
'cause you were preparing for
the Correspondents' Dinner,

but you also had time to train,
and then run, a 50-mile race.
-Yeah.
-And I know you to be a runner.

name:Michelle wolf

text:-Yeah.
[ Cheers and applause ]
-What convinced you
to try to do 50 miles at once?
-Well, I wanted to do --
It's an ultra marathon.
And I wanted to do that because,
like, anyone can do a marathon.
Like, even you did a marathon.
-Yeah, I've done one.
-Except for that one...
-Yeah.

-Well, I had a leg injury.
-But you didn't finish.
-Yeah.
[ Laughter ]
You couldn't do it, yeah.

-Or you could have sucked it up.

[ Laughter ]
-Yeah, yeah.

text:-Well, I didn't.
So, but if you --
-Most people power through it.
[ Light laughter ]
-Where did you do your 50-mile?
-It was in the Salt Flats
in Utah.
And, oh. [ Laughs ]
[ Light laughter ]
We have a salt flat here.
-Or just someone who --

someone who loves salt.
-Yeah, it's great. It's just...
No, so then I spent the weekend
in Utah,

And I was at -- I was with
my nephews at a playground.
I wasn't by myself, I promise.
[ Light laughter ]

at the playground
wearing a T-shirt
that said, "Porn kills love."
At the playground!
-Yeah.
-With the children!
-Right.
-'Cause they need to know.
-[ Laughs ] That's true.
-But I was like -- I was like,

text:regardless of your feelings
about porn,
like, graphic tees
definitely kill love.
[ Laughter ]
That's -- No one has ever been
like, "Oh, a graphic tee!
I feel like that manatee now."
[ Laughter ]
-That's how I proposed.
I wore a "Will you marry me?"

So you're preparing

-Yeah.
-This is very exciting.
How has preparation gone so far?

hate this show.
[ Laughter ]
-That, I think, is good to hear
for a lot of people.
Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the President
of the United States is still super pissed
about the fact that Michelle Wolf made a joke
about her at the Saturday evening White House
Correspondents' Dinner.

name:Michelle wolf

text:During a recent appearance on Sean Hannity's
Fox News program, Kellyanne Conway went off
into this weird little diatribe about what
happened Saturday night.
Take a look at the clip.
It's a little bit longer, but you got to watch
it to the end, because this is really weird.
She opens a can of worms that I don't think
she wanted to open.
Take a look at that.

name:Michelle wolf

text:Sean, in some ways, there was very little
that was surprising on Saturday night, though.
The faux outrage from some people who look
down at Twitter all day long and see the likes
of Sarah, and Ivanka, and me insulted, this
just happened right in front of them where
they were all gussied up, so they couldn't
deny it.
I mean, in some ways, it was just another
day at the office.
They know that we're insulted,
but it doesn't make some people any less miserable

name:Michelle wolf

text:or us any less powerful and dutiful to the
jobs that we have on behalf of the country
that we love.
I actually think both events Saturday night
really helped President Trump.
First, he got to go to Michigan and tell ... he
was in Washington, Michigan, touting-
So smart, yeah.
The economic progress of security, the historic
nature of what's going on in Korea.

name:Michelle wolf

text:Then the event here in Washington helped him
as well, because it fed right into all of
the cynicism, the skepticism, that a lot of
Americans have about the mainstream media
writ large.
They have a 14% approval rating.
Let me ask you this.
Let me say something.

name:Michelle wolf

text:I spent tonight trying to find out how much
Michelle Wolf was paid, and nobody will give
me a straight answer.
I called three people who were on the dais
who actually picked up the phone.
No one will give me an answer.
Two said that they had no idea.
There aren't any kinds of
like that, no expenditures-

name:Michelle wolf

text:I'd like to know about the media's ... I'd
like to know about anchors' and reporters'
financial holdings too, considering everyone
cares about mine.
Well, no, but hold on.
But hold on.
The reason I say this is, we're told this
is a scholarship dinner.
Yeah, she should pay for your entertainment,
but I feel really badly for those students.

name:Michelle wolf

text:The president and the vice president met them
at the White House.
They took pictures with them the other day.
I had occasion all throughout-
Right.
I'm running out of time.
 at different events to
meet these scholarship winners.

name:Michelle wolf

text:I feel sorry for them, because they were almost
an afterthought that night.
I don't want anybody to say this was about
them.
This was about the First Amendment.
When the President of the White House Correspondents'
Association stood up and said, "An attack
on one journalist is an attack on all journalists-"
You know what, Kellyanne?

name:Michelle wolf

text:You're absolutely right.
If an attack on one woman or two women, as
you say, is an attack on all women, then let's
talk about attacks on women.
Specifically, let's talk about the attack
from your boss, "I moved on her like a ****." How
does that play out, because that to me, sounds
like an actual physical, sexual attack on
a woman.

name:Michelle wolf

text:How about "Grab 'em by the *****"? How does
that play out when you're feigning outrage
over the fact that a female comedian made
a joke about you?
There are real attacks on women happening
in this country.
According to at least 19 different women right
now, some of those attacks came from your
boss, unwanted sexual advances.
But you just want to gloss over those.

name:Michelle wolf

text:You've actually said that these women are
just liars, that none of this is true.
But a comedian, somebody who was paid, and
according to you, you can't find out how much,
but you damn sure want to know, she was paid
to go up there and basically roast people.
She spent a good amount of time roasting the
press as well.
But you, because it was on you personally
for one joke, you can't handle it.
You're willing to overlook the allegations
of sexual assault against the President of

name:Michelle wolf

text:the United States, but a female comedian making
a joke about you, well, that's just crossing
a line, and something needs to happen here,
right?
That's not how it works.
There are problems that women in this country
face, and you've probably faced them too throughout
your career.
Those are the ones that need to be addressed,
but you going after this woman for making

name:Michelle wolf

text:a couple jokes, which she was paid to do,
if that's the biggest thing you have to be
outraged at, then I'm actually jealous of
you, because I would love it if I had nothing
worse to worry about in my life than a comedian
making a couple jokes about me.

so glad you guys are all here tonight to
honor a great American tradition because

I get it
we got to address the elephant that's

name:Michelle wolf

is a very long flight it'd be hard for
Vlad to make it plants can't just make
it on a Saturday it's a Saturday as for

because he can't take a joke now for the

didn't want to be roasted tonight by the
looks of them he's been roasting

historically the president usually
performs at the Correspondents Dinner
but I think I speak for all of us when I
say he's done far too much bombing this
month now a lot of people in the media

name:Michelle wolf

text:say that Donald Trump goes golfing too
much that's always like he goes golfing
too much which raises a very important
question why do you care do you want to
do do you want to know what he's not
doing when he's golfing being president

distracted teach him how to play Batman
tell him he has a great body for

as if the daily show should be on c-span
it has less zero impact it was true and
I realized something maybe it's because

Trust is more important than truth and
supporters of President Trump trust him
and I know journalists you guys are
definitely trying to do good work I just
think that a lot of people don't trust

balls I don't I don't have a solution on

name:Michelle wolf

text:that you guys have to be more perfect
now more than ever because you are how
the president gets his news
not some advisors not from experts not
from intelligence agencies you guys so
that's why you had to be on your a-game

name:Michelle wolf

text:you got to be twice as good you can't
make any mistakes because when one of
you messes up he blames your entire
group and now you know what it feels
like to be a minority and I think we
some of you guys complaining like what I

name:Michelle wolf

text:got to work twice as hard for half the
credit remember you're a minority you
guys got a lot more experience than me
but I got three decades of being brown
so if you want to survive the age of
Trump you got to think like a minority

name:Michelle wolf

text:and now that you're minority oh man
everyone is going to expect you to be
the mouthpiece for the entire group so I
hate to say it but somewhere right now
all of you being represented by Geraldo
Rivera see now that you're a truly

name:Michelle wolf

text:minority there's a distorted version of
you out there you know Taco Bell for
Mexican culture and Express for Chinese
culture Huffington Post for journalism
and then when you actually manage to do
great work you get hit with the most

so MSNBC because we got our minority

mark giving you tape for your nipples

events I have ever done in my life to be

name:Michelle wolf

text:honest with you like I feel like I'm a
tribute in the hunger game like if this
goes poorly Steve Brandon gets to eat me
but I was asked to not roast the
president and administration in their
absentia and I completely understand

name:Michelle wolf

text:that we are in a very strange situation
where there is a very combative
relationship between the press and the
president but now that you guys are
minorities just for this moment you
might understand the position I was in

name:Michelle wolf

text:it and it's the same position a lot of
minority tips feel in this country and
it's you know do I come up here and just
try to fit in and not ruffle any
feathers or do I say how I really feel
because this event is about celebrating

name:Michelle wolf

text:the First Amendment and free speech free
speech is the foundation of an open and
liberal democracy from college campuses
to the White House only in America can a
first-generation Indian American Muslim
kid get on this stage and make fun of

the orange man behind the Muslim van and
it's assigned to the rest of the world
is this amazing tradition that shows the
entire world that even the president is
not beyond the reach of the First

name:Michelle wolf

text:Amendment but the president didn't show
up because Donald Trump doesn't care
about free speech
the man who tweets everything that
enters his head refuses to acknowledge
the amendment that allows him to do it

name:Michelle wolf

text:think about it it's almost what is at
11:00 it's 11:00 p.m. right now in four
hours Donald Trump will be tweeting
about how bad Nicki Minaj bombed at this
dinner and he'll be doing it completely
sober and that's his right and I'm proud

name:Michelle wolf

text:that all of us are here tonight to
defend that right even if the man in the
White House never would so I'd like to
thank the White House Correspondents
Association for having me here I want to
thank all of you I want to thank

-Here at "Late Night,"
every night,
I deliver a monologue
comprised of jokes
written by a diverse team
of writers.

name:Michelle wolf

text:As a result, a lot of jokes
come across my desk
that, due to my being
a straight, white male,
would be difficult
for me to deliver.
But we don't think that should
stop you from enjoying them,
so we'd like to share them
with you now

"Jokes Seth Can't Tell."

So, here's how this works --
I'll read the set-up
for these jokes,

do they call potato chips?

Like, every morning I walk into
the writers' room,

-"Everyone in Slovenia is
talking about it."
-No, I think that's a thing
people like.

no one ever watches them.
-I always assumed that
after I left the room
you all talked about
how exciting it was
that I told you about a film
you didn't want to see.
-Yeah, that's what we said.
[ Laughter ]
That's definitely what we said.

you're a good boss so far?

I don't have any Michelles

So all my writers
are really nice.
-Yeah.

text:You would even write things
on purpose
just because you wanted to hear
me say them.
You didn't think
they would work.
-Yes.
-You just thought
they would delight you
because I would fail,
and you enjoyed my failure.

text:-It's fun.
-Yeah.
[ Laughter ]
Is there anything -- is there
anything that you're not good at
that they figured out
that they want to make you do?
-Yeah, no, they figured out
almost immediately
that I can't do accents.

name:Michelle wolf

text:-Yeah.
-And so they write into a lot of
the jokes, me doing an accent,
and I can't do --
like, I can't do any accent.
I can barely do my voice.
[ Laughter ]
-Well, your voice seems like
it takes a lot of energy.
-It is!
[ Laughter ]

text:It's so hard!
-The fact that -- I mean,
the fact that you --
I mean, with the calories you
burned in that 50-mile race,
how did you have anything left
to speak for, like, days?
-Oh, it was easy,
I'm telling you.
You wouldn't have been able
to do it.

because then you could show
that women can do anything
as long as their husband
did it first.
[ Laughter ]

name:Michelle wolf

text:And I would have loved to have
Bill Clinton
as the First Gentleman
because the spouse of
the President
is the one who sometimes give
tours of the White House,
and I would have loved to see
Bill be like,
"These are our drapes.

name:Michelle wolf

text:They're covered in my semen."
[ Laughter ]
"Everything in this office is
covered in my semen."
[ Laughter ]
"Don't turn on a black light."

now it's time to my special guest

name:Michelle wolf

text:tonight's guest is one of my favorite
comedians she caused a global sensation
after she delivered an incredible set at
the Correspondents Dinner attacking
Trump and his White House here we are
the White House Correspondents Dinner

name:Michelle wolf

text:like the porn star says when she's about
to have sex with the Trump let's get
this over with
last night's White House correspondence
that are turned into a travesty when
comedian Michelle wolf turned in a crude

name:Michelle wolf

text:and cursing performance I don't think
she noticed she's not here and I know I
know I would drag him here myself but it
turns out the President of the United
States is the one pussy you're not
allowed to grab

name:Michelle wolf

text:[Applause]
[Music]
curtsey yeah did you do that because
you're in England yeah yeah what'd you
do all right yeah
what an amazing year you've had massive

name:Michelle wolf

text:it's been interesting yeah yeah so for
people who don't know what the White
House Correspondents Dinner is could you
explain so the the the pressroom that
you see if you ever watched press
briefing all the reporters in there are

name:Michelle wolf

text:part of the White House Correspondents
Association so they have a dinner every
year that they called nerd prom where
they all go they let down their
non-existent hair and they eat dinner
and like there's a comedian that comes

name:Michelle wolf

text:up that whose sole job is to roast the
president and the people there that is
the job they are hired to do and and
then that's it yeah I'm now because of
your foreign performance not just not
yeah I I will also say the only like

name:Michelle wolf

text:Trump hasn't gotten to the
Correspondents Dinner the two years he's
been in office yeah the only other time
a president missed the Correspondents
Dinner was when Ronald Reagan and he had
just gotten shot and he called in from

name:Michelle wolf

text:the hospital really so when I say terms
of pussy I mean he's a pussy what's
fascinating about that is that you could
argue that when Obama roasted Trump that
that's kind of what led to a lot of this
that's what a lot of people say yeah

name:Michelle wolf

text:yeah yeah it was the same year Seth
Meyers did it yeah and they say between
the two of them they really got him to
run well he had we had Richard Branson
on the show and apparently Trump showed
Branson apropos of nothing like a list

name:Michelle wolf

text:of the 12 people he was gonna get even
with and that was like a year before who
else is on the list this is it but it's
that bizarre thing about this these two
billionaires is oh yeah that's my list
of all the people I'm gonna get when I'm

name:Michelle wolf

text:big he's like what the fuck is wrong
with you you said it was deeply
unsettling Wow and that's crazy because
you're a billionaire yeah just have them
killed yeah yeah just buy an island like
Richard Branson unita mo ver and then

name:Michelle wolf

text:they get lost
what you like being in the middle of a
global news shitstorm because your set
was so great thank you
III think universally beloved yeah I
think everyone loved it yeah yeah

name:Michelle wolf

text:anyone with a brain loved it yeah but a
lot of people without brains
what's the key people really got
creative in some of the ways they kind
of went after me why what did they say
there's this one all right group that

name:Michelle wolf

text:they wrote that they've made a fake news
article that I had been pled guilty to
bestiality
which I have to give them a lot of
credit on this first of all they looked
up all this personal information Bobby

name:Michelle wolf

text:put it in like my hometown newspaper
which is like a newspaper that goes out
to like 3,000 people and I had all these
facts about like where I went to school
and but the most interesting part about
it is that after pleading guilty

name:Michelle wolf

text:I was only fined $1,500 and I was like
well if you're gonna fuck a dog that's
not that much less here excellent joke
about dog fucking and currency yeah but
this is the phenomenal thing about fake
news is I mean I know you and yet I

name:Michelle wolf

text:looked that was I was like I don't think
she I don't think she's I know she's got
a high-pitched voice but yeah maybe it
was just an accident maybe I started
talking and then all these dogs came
around and I was like where are we going

name:Michelle wolf

text:to with all these dog
well how did that like is it just
hilarious or two people obviously think
it's ridiculous well I think what did
you feel the did you feel like you had
to if you walk around in New York and

name:Michelle wolf

text:you saw somebody walking a dog do you
have to go hey well yesterday I was in
line at TSA to fly over here and a bomb
dog sniffed my crotch
and I was like still got it being being
trolled by the president I mean when he

name:Michelle wolf

text:tweeted at me I don't have Twitter on my
phone or anything so I was out at a show
in Brooklyn and I got all these text
messages that the president had tweeted
about me and I was like well I can't do
anything about this I'm I'm like 45

name:Michelle wolf

text:minutes from my apartment we've actually
got the tweet we've got the tweet that
was sent to you from the president
so-called comedian Michelle wolf bombs
so badly last year the White House
Correspondents Dinner that this year for

name:Michelle wolf

text:the first time in decades
they will have an author instead of a
comedian good first step in comeback of
a dying evening and tradition maybe I
will go and this is the brilliant
response bet you'd be on my side if I

name:Michelle wolf

text:had killed a journalist a funny strange
that the White House will defend a pussy
grabber they get upset if a woman tells
jokes about them yeah it's a real weird
line to be on yeah I and I also I also
think it's like if because I took I

name:Michelle wolf

text:think part of it might be because I'm a
lady
I said pussy and they were like how dare
she yeah yeah that's only for men to set
men struggle saying it I think put like
particular here but it's a very American

name:Michelle wolf

text:what pussy yeah but you guys since they
can't hear and that's amazing
I prayed pussy for cutting any day
that's a new store I'm opening yeah
what I find baffling about you is that
like a that somebody would critique you

name:Michelle wolf

text:but also it's also a she's a typical
feminist comic I don't think you're a
feminist comic stretching it isn't it
yeah I am you know I want women to be
equal but like I like I don't know if
you guys heard this story a couple weeks

name:Michelle wolf

text:ago in America a bunch of pipe bombs
were sent to like various different
people ex-presidents Robert DeNiro you
know the regulars and before they
figured out who did it there was like a
good part of me that was like I hope

name:Michelle wolf

text:it's a woman okay
like I want women to be equal I want us
to be just as good as men but also just
as shitty you know like get out there
women be evil plus I think a pipe bomb
from a woman is gonna I mean it's gonna

name:Michelle wolf

text:be a nicer pipe bomb the packaging for
these bombs was for anything
you get a pipe bomb from a woman you're
like this wrapping blew me away
[Music]

assessment of me yeah I should be called

name:Michelle wolf

text:asshole no yeah I you know I think
people you know like they see like a

they're gonna hear like certain things
out of her yeah and I kind of try to not
be that yeah um like I love to bit you

name:Michelle wolf

text:had an amazing bit about the it was a
little while I think was last year the
free the nipple campaign on Instagram
yeah I am yeah cuz we have our hobbies
women like they wanted to free the
nipple on Instagram and I was just like

name:Michelle wolf

text:can we focus we focus here like I mean
like some some women want to be charged
and stuff and get paid the same and the
other women were like I want to free the
nipple
like honestly like I just I just think

name:Michelle wolf

text:if you focus your attention on one thing
you're much more likely to get it
accomplished yeah so like all women
voted and we decided that like freeing
the nipple is what we really wanted to
do I get on board I'm a team player yeah

name:Michelle wolf

text:but like I just can't believe it was a
woman's idea sounds like a man
infiltrated a meeting and it was like we
gotta get these nipples are you on tour
are you touring here I am I'm gonna be
touring here next summer how do you find

name:Michelle wolf

text:you find a difference gigging over here

are the White House Correspondents
Dinner like a porn star says when she's
about to have sex with the Trump let's
get this over with yeah this is you're
getting tonight I'm gonna skip it a lot

name:Michelle wolf

text:of the normal pleasantries we're at a
Hilton it's not nice this is on c-span
no one watches that Trump is president
it's not ideal the White House
Correspondents Association thank you for
having me the monkfish was fine

name:Michelle wolf

text:hey just reminder that everyone I'm here
to make jokes I have no agenda I'm not
trying to get anything accomplished so
everyone that's here from Congress you
should feel right at home
yeah before we get too far a little bit

name:Michelle wolf

text:about me a lot of you might not know who
I am I'm 32 years old which is an odd
age 10 years too young to host this
event in 20 years too old for Roy Moore
I know he almost got elected yeah it was
fun it was fun honestly I never really

name:Michelle wolf

text:thought I'd be a comedian but I did take
an aptitude test in seventh grade and
this is a hundred percent true
I took an aptitude test in seventh grade
and it said my best profession was a
clown whore a mine heard my voice and

name:Michelle wolf

text:was like or maybe my thinking about mine
and I know as much as some of you might
want me to its 2018 and I am a woman so
you cannot shut me up
unless you have Michael Cohen wire me a
hundred and thirty thousand dollars

name:Michelle wolf

text:Michael you can find me on venmo under
my porn star name Reince Priebus
Brian's just gave a thumbs up okay now
people are saying America is more
divided and than ever but I think no
matter what you support politically we

name:Michelle wolf

text:can all agree that this is a great time
for craft stores because of all the pros
because of all the protest poster board
has been flying off the shelves faster
than Robert Mueller can say you've been
subpoenaed thanks to trump pink yarn

name:Michelle wolf

text:sales are through the roof after Trump
got elected women started knitting those
pussy hats when I first saw him I was
like that's a pussy I guess mine just
has a lot more yarn on it yeah should
have done more research before you got

name:Michelle wolf

text:me to do this
now there is a lot to cover tonight
there's a lot to go over I can't get to
everything I know there's a lot of
people that want me to talk about Russia
and Putin and collusion but I'm not

name:Michelle wolf

text:gonna do that because there's also a lot
of liberal media here and I've never
really wanted to know what any of you
look like when you orgasm I bet it's
something like this okay that's all the
time we have

name:Michelle wolf

text:[Applause]
it is kind of crazy that the Trump
campaign was in contact with Russia when
the Hillary campaign wasn't even in
contact with Michigan of course Trump is
in here if you haven't noticed she's not

name:Michelle wolf

text:here and I know I know I would drag him
here myself
but it turns out the President of the
United States is the one pussy you're
not allowed to grab
[Applause]

name:Michelle wolf

text:[Music]
now I know people really want me to go
after Trump tonight but I think we
should give the president credit when he
deserves it
like he pulled out of the Paris

name:Michelle wolf

text:agreement and I think he should get
credit for that cuz he said he was gonna
pull out and then he did and that's a
refreshing quality in a man
most men are like I forgot I'll get you
next time

name:Michelle wolf

text:oh there's gonna be a next time
people say romance is dead people called
Trump names all the time and look I
could call Trump a racist or a
misogynist or xenophobic or unstable or
incompetent or impotent but he's heard

name:Michelle wolf

text:all of those and he doesn't care so
tonight I'm gonna try to make fun of the
president in a new way in a way that I
think will really get them mr. president
I don't think you're very rich like I
think you might be rich in Idaho but in

name:Michelle wolf

text:New York you're doing fine
drum is the only person that still
watches Who Wants to Be a Millionaire
and things me although I'm not sure
you'd get very far you get to like the
third question and you'd be like I have

name:Michelle wolf

text:to phone a fox and friend we're gonna
try a fun new thing okay I'm gonna say
Trump is so broke and you guys go how
broke is he all right
Trump is so broke yet the fly failed
business class

name:Michelle wolf

text:trap myself bro he looked for foreign
oil and Don Jr's hair Trump is so proud
the Southwest used him as one of their
engines I know it's so soon it's so soon
for that joke why did she tell it it's
so soon Trump is so broke he had to

name:Michelle wolf

text:borrow money from the Russians and now
he's compromised and not susceptible to
blackmail and possibly responsible for
collapse of the Republic yay
it's a fun game Trump is racist though
he loves white nationalists which is a

name:Michelle wolf

text:weird term for a Nazi calling and not
see a white nationalist is like calling
a pedophile a kid friend
or Harvey Weinstein a ladies man which
isn't really fair he also likes plants
trebs also an idea guy he's got loads of

name:Michelle wolf

text:ideas you gotta love him for that he
wants to give teachers guns and I
support that because then they can sell
them for things they need like supplies
protractors a lot of people want Trump
to be impeached I do not because just

name:Michelle wolf

text:when you think Trump is awful you
remember Mike Pettine my pence is what
happens when Anderson Cooper isn't gay
my the kind of guy that brushes his
teeth and then drinks orange juice and
things mmm

name:Michelle wolf

text:Mike Pence is also very anti choice
he thinks abortion is murder which first
of all don't knock it till you try it
and when you do try it really knock it
you know you gotta get that baby out of
there and yeah sure you can groan all

name:Michelle wolf

text:you won I know a lot of you are very
anti-abortion you know unless it's the
one you got for your secret mistress
fuckin waiver but good for you my guess
is a weirder though he's a weird little
guy he might he won't meet with other

name:Michelle wolf

text:women without his wife present when
people first heard this they were like
that's crazy but now in this current
climate they're like that's a good
witness which of course brings me to the
me2 movement it's probably the reason

name:Michelle wolf

text:I'm here they were like a woman's
probably not gonna jerk off in front of
anyone right and to that I say don't
count your chickens lose a lot of party
now I've worked in a lot of
male-dominated fields before comedy I

name:Michelle wolf

text:worked at a tech company and before that
I worked on Wall Street and honestly
I've never really been sexually harassed
that being said I did work at Bear
Stearns in 2008 so although I haven't
been sexually harassed I've definitely

name:Michelle wolf

text:been
yeah that whole company went down on me
without my consent and no man got in
trouble for that one either
no things are changing men are being
held accountable you know Al Franken was

name:Michelle wolf

text:ousted that one really hurt liberals but
I believe it was the great Ted Kennedy
who said wow that's crazy I murdered a
woman Chappaquiddick in theaters now I
did have a lot of jokes I had a lot of
jokes about cabinet members but I had to

name:Michelle wolf

text:scrap all of those because everyone has
been fired you guys are going through
cabinet members quicker than Starbucks
throws out black people don't worry
they're having an afternoon that'll
solve it we just needed an afternoon

name:Michelle wolf

text:Mitch McConnell isn't here tonight he
had a prior engagement he's finally
getting his neck circumcised Mazal paul
ryan also couldn't make it
of course he's already been circumcised
unfortunately why they were down there

name:Michelle wolf

text:they also took his boss
yeah my pop great acting though in that
video Republicans aren't easy to make
fun of you know it's like shooting fish
in a Chris Christie but I also want to
make fun of Democrats Democrats are

name:Michelle wolf

text:harder to make fun of because you guys
don't do anything
people think you might flip the House
and Senate this November but you guys
always find a way to mess it up you're
somehow going to lose by 12 points to a

name:Michelle wolf

text:guy named Jeff pedophile Nazi doctor
oh he's a doctor we should definitely
talk about the women in the Trump
administration there's Kellyanne Conway

what she does Conway it's like if my

name:Michelle wolf

text:name was Michele jokes frizzy hair small
tits
you guys got to stop putting Kellyanne

don't give her a platform she has
nowhere to lie it's like that old saying

name:Michelle wolf

text:if a tree falls in the woods how do we
get Kelly in and under that tree not
suggesting she gets hurt just stuck
under a tree incidentally a tree falls
in the woods is Scott Pruitt's
definition of porn yeah we all have our

name:Michelle wolf

text:kinks there's also a course of vodka she
was supposed to be an advocate for women
but it turns out she's about as helpful
to women as an empty box of tampons
she's done nothing to satisfy women so I
guess like father like daughter

name:Michelle wolf

text:oh you don't think he's good in bed come
on she doesn't clean up nice though
Ivanka cleans up nice she's the diaper
genie of the administration on the
outside she looks sleek but the inside

-Saturday night was
the White House
Correspondents' Dinner
in Washington, D.C.
I hosted it before --
once in 2011.
And this morning, Donald Trump
had this to say on Twitter.

name:Michelle wolf

text:"the White House
Correspondents' Dinner
was a failure last year,
but this year was
an embarrassment to everyone
associated with it.
The filthy 'comedian'
totally bombed --
couldn't even deliver her lines,
much like the Seth Meyers
weak performance."

name:Michelle wolf

text:[ Laughter ]
Oh, good.
It's always nice when
the Eye of Sauron is upon you.
[ Laughter ]
First of all, thank you
for bringing it up.
It is one of the best nights
of my life.
And I would personally
bring it up all the time,

name:Michelle wolf

text:but it would look tacky.
[ Laughter ]
Second of all, the filthy
comedian you mention
is Michelle Wolf,
and she used to work here.
Now, Michelle Wolf doesn't need
anyone to defend her,
but she is our friend.
So just know,
when you call her filthy,
you are right.

name:Michelle wolf

text:[ Laughter and applause ]
She is filthy.
And she is mean, which is
what we love about her,
because those are wonderful
qualities for comedians
and terrible qualities
for Free World leaders.
[ Cheers and applause ]
But...

name:Michelle wolf

text:you want to know
how filthy she is?
Here she is playing
Grown-up Annie on our show.
>> And all this work
with Annie's Nannies
has gotten me to look inward.
And I realized I've never really
felt comfortable
being who I really am...
until now.

name:Michelle wolf

text:So, Seth, I'd like to announce
that I'm getting a sex change.
>> Seth: Oh, wow.
Grown-up Annie, that is
very brave of you to admit...
-Thank you.
-...that you're getting
a sex change.
-Thank you. I know.

name:Michelle wolf

text:From now on, I'm only going to
have sex facing people.
-Oh, that's not...
[ Laughter ]
That's not a sex change.
-It is for me.
-Okay.
[ Laughter ]

name:Michelle wolf

text:That was about Annie,
an orphan!
If you ask me,
Sarah Huckabee Sanders
got off easy.
Now, Trump was going to be upset
with Michelle no matter what,
but at least the press knew
what they were getting, right?
When they announced Michelle,
Margaret Talev, president of

name:Michelle wolf

text:the White House
Correspondents' Association,
said in a statement,
"Our dinner honors
the First Amendment and
strong, independent journalism.
Michelle's embrace
of these values
and her truth-to-power style
makes her a great friend
to the White House
Correspondents' Association."

name:Michelle wolf

text:So, Michelle spoke
truth to power as advertised,
and yet yesterday,
the same Margaret Talev released
a statement saying,
"Last night's program
was meant to offer
a unifying message
about our common commitment
to a vigorous and free press
while honoring civility.

name:Michelle wolf

text:unfortunately,
the entertainer's monologue
was not in the spirit
of that mission."
You hired her!
[ Laughter ]
That's like a parent
sending an e-mail saying,
"Yesterday's birthday was meant
to celebrate
Kevin turning 6 years old.

name:Michelle wolf

the stripper's dance routine
was not in the spirit
of the party."
[ Laughter ]
Look, the whole point
of your dinner is
to supposedly celebrate
the First Amendment.
And Michelle Wolf subscribes to
the way of the Native Americans.

name:Michelle wolf

text:She uses every part
of the First Amendment.
[ Laughter ]
So, here's the good news,
Michelle Wolf has a new show
premiering on Netflix, May 27th.
It's called "The Break."
And based on what happened
Saturday,
you can be sure
that it will be great,

name:Michelle wolf

text:because she's not going to
waste any time
trying to decide when it is
or isn't proper
to make fun of
people in power
who lie to us on a daily basis.
And look, I know
you just think...
[ Cheers and applause ]

name:Michelle wolf

text:I know you just think
I'm saying this
because she's my friend,
but I can't stress this enough.
Michelle is so mean.
[ Laughter ]
I was her boss,
and she made the meanest jokes
about me all the time.

name:Michelle wolf

text:She's been gone for two years,
but I still jump when I see
a redhead on the street.
[ Laughter ]
We're lucky to have her.
Give it up for Michelle Wolf,
everybody.
[ Cheers and applause ]
like maybe she's born with it maybe it's

name:Michelle wolf

text:lies and I'm not really sure what to
call Sarah Huckabee Sanders you know is
it Sarah Sanders is it Sarah Huckabee
Sanders is it cousin Huckabee what's
uncle time but for white women who
disappoint other white women that was

name:Michelle wolf

text:that by the way it got worse after that
and after a while things got totally
quiet people just stopped laughing and
she powered through her material
enjoying it because this is what she
does and she even said at one point she

name:Michelle wolf

text:looked around and said you know you
should have done more research before
booking me and a lot of people say well
it's time to cut the comedian I don't
think it's time to cut the comedian I
think America has it since you were

name:Michelle wolf

text:about itself Don Rickles wouldn't have
been famous but I would think that Jay
Leno would be the guy well you come in
there and you use the issues and you
have fun and you mock both sides but
historically the president comes and the

name:Michelle wolf

text:president does 10 or 15 minutes and he's
hilarious but what has happened over the
last I don't know eight ten years
something like that is the president
will give a speech and then the comic
will come out and do a rebuttal and you

name:Michelle wolf

text:know that's obviously why Donald Trump
decided not to go and ultimately if the
dinner only attracts liberal presidents
and liberal comedians the conclusion
will be inevitable to the country
they're gonna go oh that White House

name:Michelle wolf

text:Correspondents Association it's just a
bunch of liberals for not wanting to go
I put yourself in that situation you
heard what happened with Kerry Sanders
she's standing she's sitting five feet
from this comedian and the comedian's

name:Michelle wolf

text:making fun of her appearance but Stephen
Colbert do the same thing to George Bush
when he was three seats away and it was
it was over the line it was over the
line but you know what Stephen Colbert
has got his niche career with is the

name:Michelle wolf

text:anti-trump people and he's leading
late-night now so I think this woman
believe it or not is actually going to
gain from this mark
okay I wasn't going to talk about
Michelle wolf and the White House

name:Michelle wolf

text:Correspondents Dinner since we normally
don't really say much about it but the
scandal around it has made me want to
have a conversation about it and what
was notable this this year about the
White House Correspondents Dinner was

name:Michelle wolf

text:that Trump didn't attend normally the
president goes they get roasted to some
degree and they generally take it pretty
well Michelle wolf headlined the event
in Trump's absence she made jokes some
were aggressive some were less

name:Michelle wolf

text:aggressive some were very funny some
were not as funny but she's getting
absolutely crushed by conservative media
and even some on the not right like not
left wingers per se but even just sort
of some general media criticism is

name:Michelle wolf

text:saying that maybe Michelle wolf went too
far and the normal MO with these things
is the people being made fun of it's
usually the president people in the
current administration sometimes media
as well they sort of all take it in

name:Michelle wolf

text:stride right because it doesn't look
good when you don't and then the
partisan analysts from the
administration's party will slam the
comedian is going too far or being too
aggressive or being insensitive or

name:Michelle wolf

text:distasteful when it was Obama you'd hear
a little bit of that from the left but
mostly it was understood that this is
comedy right it's comedy and it's comedy
period the right has absolutely lost its
mind over Michelle Wolf's joke saying

name:Michelle wolf

text:everything from it was bullying that was
Mike Huckabee who said that - it was
cruel unfair disgusting inaccurate and
this is so funny on so many levels first
and foremost being the same free speech
warriors who were supposedly against the

name:Michelle wolf

text:trigger warnings and the safe spaces are
effectively totally triggered by
Michelle wolf and arguing that she just
went too far and they wanted in practice
the White House Correspondents Dinner to
be a safer space for them than it was I

name:Michelle wolf

text:mean just a glaring hypocrisy but I
thought we should actually look at what
Michelle Wolf said because what really
seems to be getting to them is that
everything Michelle Michelle Wolf said
other than like the clearly sarcastic or

name:Michelle wolf

text:joking comments was true right she
opened with a joke about a porn star
having sex with Trump that happened or
at least there's every indication that
it happened she said Congress
accomplishes

name:Michelle wolf

text:little that's true most people in the
United States degree she said that at
age 32 she's 20 years older than the age
that would make ROI more find her
attractive more hasn't denied pursuing
girls not that much older than 12 right

name:Michelle wolf

text:it's an edgy joke but it's a fine joke
to be making she referred to Michael
Cohen writing a hundred and thirty
thousand dollar check to someone he did
that what's the big deal she joked about
the liberal media being turned on by the

name:Michelle wolf

text:Trump Russia collusion story that's a
critique of liberal media why would
conservatives be mad about that
she said Hillary wasn't in contact with
Michigan that's a critique of Hillary
Clinton's campaign she joked about Trump

name:Michelle wolf

text:phoning into Fox & Friends
he does phone into Fox & Friends all the
time why is that a big deal she joked
about maybe Trump isn't as rich as he
says he is well we know that that's
something that bothers Trump it's not

name:Michelle wolf

text:original material others have suggested
that she said Trump is a racist I mean
yeah that's a matter of debate but it's
not really unique or controversial at
this point to say that Trump has racist
tendencies she suggested that a Trump

name:Michelle wolf

text:impeachment might be bad because it
would lead to Mike Pence who's worse
I've been saying that and many others
have been saying that for more than a
year I don't see how that's offensive
she joked about people being against

name:Michelle wolf

text:abortion until their secret mistress
needs an abortion that's a real story
about many Republicans and even some
anti-choice Democrats when it comes to
abortions only for their mistresses and
not for anybody else she joked about

name:Michelle wolf

text:Republicans having not see candidates
that just happened in Illinois that
actually is a real thing
she said Kellyanne Conway lies that's
undeniably true
she said Ivanka has done nothing as a

name:Michelle wolf

text:women's rights advocate I would agree
with that and then she got into Sarah
Huckabee Sanders and this made a lot of
people mad she joked that Sarah Huckabee
Sanders is like aunt Lydia in a
Handmaid's Tale she accused Sarah

name:Michelle wolf

text:Huckabee Sanders of constant lying she
joked about Sarah Huckabee Sanders being
a disappointment to women is this really
that bad like you would only really be
triggered by that if you recognize that
it's all completely true and then she

name:Michelle wolf

text:made a joke about Sarah Huckabee Sanders
Smokey Eye Makeup and people said well
is she starting to make fun of Sarah
Huckabee Sanders
parents give me a break they should all
be thrilled that that's the full extent

name:Michelle wolf

text:to which Sarah Huckabee Sanders
appearance was ridiculed right and I've
been very clear I think Sarah Huckabee
Sanders is terrible for the lies that
she tells but one could if they wanted
to is Trump did too many of his opposing

name:Michelle wolf

text:Republican candidates ridicule the way
they look
joked about Fox News having a problem
with predators of women I mean that that
is true that's true made some jokes
about Rachel Maddow that's not even

name:Michelle wolf

text:about the ride she said Trump is so
broke that he grabs pussies looking for
loose change I mean that that relates to
news stories if this is offensive speech
to Republicans they are even more
thin-skinned than we thought and we

name:Michelle wolf

text:thought they were pretty damn
thin-skinned and I feel like if there is
legitimate criticism to make here it's
that these aren't really jokes for the
most part there were just like
observations about reality yes and I

name:Michelle wolf

text:think that's why comedians nowadays are
having such a tough time in the era of
Trump because reality is already pretty
hilarious so there's nowhere to take it
I mean you can't like flip it you can't
make it satirical you can't exaggerate

name:Michelle wolf

text:it and then they could argue that it
wasn't funny that would be a criticism
but most people don't get offensive by
things that aren't funny they just don't
laugh and then move on with their lives
so it appears that what the right really

name:Michelle wolf

text:hated about Michelle wolf speech was
that it contained mostly the truth
there's one other angle here which is
that because Michelle wolf did go after
corporate media in a lot of ways
corporate media may have decided to

name:Michelle wolf

text:enable Michelle Wolf's critics to come
on and slam her because she slammed them
during her jokes that's another possible
angle which is interesting yeah it could
be a silver lining that this could take
down the White House Correspondents

name:Michelle wolf

text:Dinner they're actually talking about
getting rid of the comedy not only over
this incident but also Stephen Colbert's
roasting of George W Bush yeah that
would be a great thing I think the
Correspondents Dinner is a little bit

name:Michelle wolf

text:too cozy between the media and those in
charge so well I'd like to see them get
rid of it listen you got rid of the
president this year they can get rid of
the jokes next year what will be left I
guess just like a a dried fish dish that

name:Michelle wolf

text:gets served to everybody in the room I
don't know what else they'll have the
video you just watched was made possible
by support from you please go to
patreon.com slash david pakman show you
can make a pledge of as little as $1 per

name:Michelle wolf

text:month and every dollar helps to
port the work that we're doing
particularly in light of the YouTube ad
boycott which has been really bad

name:Trevor Noah

text:Michael Cohen told Congress that
President Trump is a racist a conman and
a cheat
which would have been big news if it
wasn't also the slogan for Trump's 2020
campaign but it was interesting to hear

name:Trevor Noah

text:Cohen give examples of trumps racism in
private settings he once asked me if I
can name a country run by a black person
that wasn't a shit hole this was when
Barack Obama was President of the United
States and while we were once driving

name:Trevor Noah

text:through a struggling neighborhood in
Chicago he commented that only black
people could live that way and he told
me that black people would never vote
for him because they were too stupid
what black people wouldn't vote for you

name:Trevor Noah

text:Trump because they're too stupid no
Donald
actually the reason black people
wouldn't vote for you is because of your
trash ass weave look at that thing what
is that what did you get it from it

name:Trevor Noah

text:looks like you couldn't afford the good
shit from India so you just have to take
it off the horses in Central Park that's
that's why black people didn't vote for
you also the 50 years of well-documented
racism but mostly they leave my friend

name:Trevor Noah

text:now in response to Cohen's racism
accusations the Republicans on the
committee put forward an airtight
response to prove that Trump is the
least racist person you will ever meet
Marc Meadows bringing in Lyndon Patton

name:Trevor Noah

text:who works for the administration as
proof that Donald Trump is not a racist
I asked Lynn to come today in her
personal capacity to actually shed some
light it has to do with your claim of
racism

name:Trevor Noah

text:she says that as a daughter of a man
born in Birmingham Alabama that there is
no way that she would work for it for an
individual who was racist Bravo Bravo
they used the black friend defense I
cannot be racist because as you can see

name:Trevor Noah

text:I have a black friend
there are so many things about this that
I find funny one
whenever the Trump's are accused of
racism they always bring the same woman
I don't know if you've noticed that like

name:Trevor Noah

text:if you can only bring one black person
every time something tells me you don't
have black friends and also I wonder how
many times she has to show up to places
because of something racist trump has
said like it feels like she has to bail

name:Trevor Noah

text:him out at 3m she's probably getting
text from Trump like quick Lynne I need
you to come down to the golf club
I thought someone where's Steve Harvey
but it was not Steve Harvey it was like
sign like a bat signal for her is like a

name:Trevor Noah

text:black signal just like save me and now
Cohen made it clear that he had no hard
proof of Trump coordinating with Russia
during the campaign but he did share one
memory that looking back on it says you
know that it could be proof that Trump

name:Trevor Noah

text:knew about the infamous Trump Tower
meeting Don Trump jr. came into the room
and walked behind his father's desk
which in and of itself was unusual
people didn't just walk behind mr.
Trump's desk to talk to him and I recall

name:Trevor Noah

text:Don jr. leave leaning over to his father
and speaking in a low voice which I
could clearly hear and saying the
meeting is all set and I remember mr.
Trump saying okay good let me know you
know the best part of that little story

name:Trevor Noah

text:isn't that Trump may have known about
the Russia Trump Tower meeting it's that
Don jr. doesn't know how to whisper
and Cohen had plenty of other
revelations today you know details on
Trump potentially committing campaign

name:Trevor Noah

text:finance crimes by paying off stormy
Daniels and how he fraudulently used his
charity to pay for a portrait of himself
and how Trump influenced Cohen to lie
about his business dealings with Russia
but Trump supporters on the House

name:Trevor Noah

text:Committee they kept coming back to the
same point why should we believe Michael
Cohen I don't believe that Michael Cohen
is capable of telling the truth Michael
Cohen fraudster cheat convicted felon
and in two months of federal inmate how

name:Trevor Noah

text:on earth is this witness credible
he's a fake witness and his presence
here is a travesty you're about to go to
prison for lying how can we believe
anything you say the answer is we can't
look at the old adage that our moms

name:Trevor Noah

text:taught us liar liar pants on fire no one
should ever listen to you and give you
credibility uh whose mom took them lie
liar pants on fire I'm pretty sure that
was the kids two kids think that wasn't
a mom thing as my wise mother always

name:Trevor Noah

text:said to me I know you are but what am i
that's what my mom said all the time
and look these Republicans do have a
point right as Cohen himself has
admitted he lied to America on behalf of
Donald Trump for ten years in fact he's

name:Trevor Noah

text:soon going to prison partly because he
already lied to Congress so why take his
word on any of this stuff well we may
not have to take his word because Cohen
also brought the receipts I am giving to
the committee today three years of mr.

name:Trevor Noah

text:Trump's personal financial statements I
am providing a copy of a $35,000 check
that President Trump personally signed
from his personal bank account on August
1st of 2017 when he was president of the
United States a copy of the $130,000

name:Trevor Noah

text:wire transfer I'm giving the committee
today copies of a letter I sent at mr.
Trump's direction threatening these
schools with civil and criminal actions
mr. Trump directed me to threaten his
high school his colleges and the College

name:Trevor Noah

text:Board to never release
his grades or SAT scores okay that that
part is just hilarious how bad would
Trump's grades that he threatened to sue
his school if they release them like I
swear to God if you tell anyone I got a

name:Trevor Noah

text:d-minus in math I will destroy you oh
maybe we assume that maybe it's
something else maybe Trump doesn't want
anyone finding out he got an A in
Spanish he's just like if this gets out
my supporters are gonna be so mad and

name:Trevor Noah

text:don't say solamente no BND ass I mean
bad hombres build the wall I look you
almost can't blame Republicans for
caring more about protecting their
presidents than getting to the truth all
right that's just how politics works

name:Trevor Noah

text:these days but Michael Cohen did have a
warning for them I did the same thing
that you're doing now
for ten years I protected mr. Trump for
ten years and I can only warn people the
more people that follow mr. Trump as I

name:Trevor Noah

text:did blindly are going to suffer the same
consequences that I'm suffering Wow
that is a powerful powerful statement
and in response the Republican
congressman replied I'm rubber you're
glue I yield the remainder of my time

who is to blame for this crisis well if
you listen to the president which by the
way I don't recommend you do but if you

whether it's the opioids whether it's
drugs as you hear in the traditional
sense much comes through the southern
border the opioid is a tremendous
emergency and I tell you what we've

name:Trevor Noah

need the wall one of the reasons we want
the strong borders a lot of this stuff
comes in from different places but it
comes in from Mexico it comes along the
southern border Trump blames Mexico for

text:everything the opioid crisis factories
closing crime in America I wouldn't be
shocked if he's in bed with his wife and
she's like what's wrong Donald can't get
it up he's like it sees god damn
emigrants not you baby the other ones

name:Trevor Noah

text:the other ones but in reality
the opioid crisis is as American as
baseball or student loan debt because it
wasn't Mexican drug dealers that got
people addicted alright that was the
work of homegrown

that's a very large number if it's taken
properly how can you take 60

name:Trevor Noah

people need that dose there is no
scientific evidence to support that
claim
goddamn 60 oxycodone a day this guy
deserves 150 years in prison I bet when

but that's a life sentence and the judge
was like well no not if you space it out
properly it actually works out now the
truth is as bad as this guy is doctors
like this are basically low-level

name:Trevor Noah

text:henchmen right if you want to find the
source of the opioid problem you have to
go to the top of the cartel pharma
companies that make the drugs former
executives and managers for iNSYS
therapeutics are on trial in Boston

name:Trevor Noah

text:they're accused of bribing doctors to
prescribe a highly addictive fentanyl
spray
prosecutors say five Manhattan doctors
were paid more than eight hundred
thousand dollars combined from iNSYS

and expensive strip club visits one of
the former executives the former
stripper turned sales woman who
prosecutors say bribed doctors and in
some cases got personal with them also

name:Trevor Noah

text:they would prescribe the company's drug
that's right this drug company didn't
just bribe doctors to push opioids they
sent strippers to bribe the doctors
and let me just say when a stripper
starts paying you something fishy is

name:Trevor Noah

text:going on all right that just doesn't
make sense doesn't make sense it's like
a crackhead begging to give you $5.00
hey brother you look like you could use
some help come on man take it now that's
just one example of how drug companies

name:Trevor Noah

text:are pushing doctors to over prescribe
opioids and that drug company is small
time compared to the Pablo Escobar of
opioids the Sackler family we're hearing
from the Massachusetts Attorney General
who blames the founding family of a

text:pharmaceutical company for helping
create the opioid drug crisis in a
lawsuit the state targets Purdue Pharma
and eight members of the Sackler family
it alleges they are personally
responsible for deceptively selling

federal court in 2007 that it had misled
doctors and consumers about just how
addictive oxycontin can be the lawsuit
contends that from 2008 to 2016 alone
members of the Sackler family paid

name:Trevor Noah

text:themselves more than four billion
dollars in opioid profits that's right
this one family made four billion
dollars by allegedly lying about how
addictive opioids are that is
straight-up evil if your product is

it I mean that's why we always start our

I didn't give that warning and it's bad
enough that the second was reportedly
lied about how addictive their drugs
were but according to the court filing
they then turned around and blamed their

first place the newly unredacted

Richard Sackler then Purdue chairman and

abusers in every way possible
they are the culprits and the problem
they are reckless criminals this is pure
evil but you and
here evil they got people hooked on

name:Trevor Noah

them for being hooked this is like if a
guy at Cinnabon was like have you tried
the Cinnabon breadsticks have you tried
the have you saw the cinnamon sticks
yeah

name:Trevor Noah

text:oh and if you had you've got to try the
caramel pecan bun yeah yeah and you do
not want to get on that plane without

I'm like okay you've got me I'll try
them all and then he's like you fat

name:Trevor Noah

text:disgust me wait what what and according
to allegations in the complaint blaming
the addicts was just a small part of the
seconds diabolical master plan right
because once they got people addicted
they tried to make money treating the

it or not that wasn't even their most
sinister idea the maker of the highly
addictive painkiller oxycontin is now
trying to get FDA approval to label it
as suitable for use by children as young

text:as six years old Wow Wow yeah what
that's right even after they knew full
well how addictive their drug was they
still wanted to make a version for kids
like nobody should ever want kids doped
up on opioids all right like I'm

M.E.C. of safety and security.

text:True genius.
True comedic genius.
Like we all have our mentors and you know
I look up to guys like him.
No because he came out after what happened
was there was a funeral on the weekend.
And what happened was there was a lightning
storm and lightning struck the people at the
funeral and nine people were killed instantly.

name:Trevor Noah

text:There's nothing funny about that.
Nine people dead, gone.
Nothing funny at all.
Although it must've been a bit weird because
like, you know?
You're there because someone has died and
then *lightning sound effects*
Then it's a bit awkward now.

name:Trevor Noah

text:You don't know if carry on here or do you? You don't know but it's a bit you don't
know and then you're like do you put them
in because there's like cause you know there's
going to be like one uncle who's like "No
there's space... put him.
I must buy another box?
nuh uh."
It's just like, you know what I mean?

name:Trevor Noah

text:And if you've got like one of those possessive mothers, you know those mothers that love their kids.
Probably then she's crying and then everyone's like
*lightning sound effects* and then they're dead.
Then they're like "ahhh-" and
she's like "Don't you dare!
Don't you cry for them.
You don't cry for them.
You came here for this.

name:Trevor Noah

text:You came here.
You save your tears and you cry where they-
Hey!
Hey! HEY!
They're freshly dead you can cry for them
next week.
You don't, you bring those tears here and-"
But there's nothing funny about it. And um...

name:Trevor Noah

text:And so what happened is on the Monday after
the funeral.
MEC came out and he held a press conference and
he was there the journalists had all gathered
and it was very serious.
And he came out there and the photographers and
everyone was there and he said,
"We...
we have heard...

name:Trevor Noah

text:what have happened...
on that funeral.
And let it be known that...
we...
will launch a
probe.
And we will not rest...

name:Trevor Noah

text:UNTIL we know...
where does this lightning come from?!"
Not rest.
His assistant was probably like "Up, up."
He was like, yes up,  we want to know!
Where does it come from?!"

name:Trevor Noah

text:I didn't even make the joke he just said this!
I just repeated it to you!
We've become a culture of distrusting, angry people.
That’s who we are, everyone’s angry.
Weird angriness as well. In places where it shouldn’t be.
I was in Checkers the other day.
I’m just shopping. It’s a normal experience, you know?

name:Trevor Noah

text:I get to the cashier and, those people are so angry.
Like, I don’t know what Checkers
does to their employees.
But they are clearly
not enjoying it.
Because I get to the till, she doesn’t greet me.
She doesn’t even look at me.
She just pushes the little conveyer belt thing.

“No, I am fine. Thank you.”
“No, I’ll just hold it, I’ll just, yea.”
“I’ll just. No, no. Thank you, thank you.”

And they look angry.

text:Because they’ve drawn they’re eyebrows on.
And that permanent scowl.
I don’t understand that trend it
fashion, I am honest with you.
Why would you shave your eyebrows off?
and then draw them back on where they were?
It’s weird, but I also commend it you know.

name:Trevor Noah

text:That level of commitment has to be commended.
Because I don’t understand how anyone can
commit to one expression for the entire day.
Like how do you choose that expression?
Do you just work on how you feel in the morning?
Is that what you do?
You just wake up and be like, “I’m feeling angry!”
“Haaaaa!”

name:Trevor Noah

text:What if something good happens? Something good. You’d be like,
”Yea Temby, you won the Lotto.”
“Yay!”
“You don’t look happy.”
“I just can’t show it.”
“I’ll draw it tomorrow.”

text:You guys, you guys love your sport out here I’ve never
seen more focus put on sport anywhere else in the world
Americans love they’re sport back to front

and then you talk about what happened in the game

name:Trevor Noah

text:and what could've and what might've but didn’t happen in the game

LeBron James leading his team out here averaging 30 points
double double every single game.
 10 points per game
Just in assists alone.

business channels and your economy
and you’re like what’s happening

Nobody knows.... Yeah!

They could can go anywhere
Those are stocks 
We don’t know

Have fun

like soccer
I am a huge fan of soccer
Yea Oh 
there’s some fans here
I love soccer. 
It’s chilled.

when the game is being played

name:Trevor Noah

text:there’s no statistics at all
the game starts off 
the whistle blows
and welcome ladies and gentlemen

it’s Spain playing against Germany

wonderful weather
And the guys just like "Oh yea John you can feel it.

what do you think’s going

Oh nobody knows

name:Trevor Noah

text:I can’t even remember the last
time I saw a game this good
Americans will remember
 Americans will go back to the finest statistic
the last time a black man scored using his left
hand jumping over a mixed-race half Indian
was in 1967 when the
Okay like what?
this is madness

name:Trevor Noah

text:I remember the worst encounter I had with the
T.S.A. was out in Burbank, California.
Tiny little airport, I was flying
out and I was coming to New York.
And so I am in Burbank airport and I go through security.
And for some reason I was beeping, I don’t know why.
I walked to the metal detector.
And I beep, go out, beep, go out, beep.
Every time I have to take something of off I go out
I got a beep and the agent, he’s just losing it.

name:Trevor Noah

text:The whole time he’s like, “take it off, take it off”
And then the machine goes beep and he’s
like, “take that off, take that off!”
“take that off!”, and he’s like getting more and more angry.
I am basically naked right now
and he’s losing it, losing it.
I felt like an under-performing stripper, it was horrible.
He’s like, “take that, no, ahhh!”

name:Trevor Noah

text:And finally he’s just like,
“get out here, get out here!”
So I walk to the side and he’s like,
“go ahead and put your hands up”
So I put my arms up.
Then he whipped out his little
metal, personal metal detector.
looks like a midget sword, but they call it the wand.
That’s what they call it, the wand. So he whips that out.

name:Trevor Noah

text:cause that hundred thousand
dollar machine, that’s play, play.
Shit just got real.
So he looks at me and says: ”go ahead and stick
your hands up sir and keep them right there”.
So I put my arms up and he scans me
*sound of a scanner*
“You got any ah... you got any metal objects on you?”

name:Trevor Noah

text:And I was like, “then what was that for?”
“If you were gonna ask me anyway, then what was this?”
“The foreplay to my honesty, what is this?”
And then as if he can’t do this right, he calls for backup.
He goes, “I’m gonna need you to wait right here”
“Can we get Velazquez to gate ah gate 10 please? Velazquez to gate 10”

name:Trevor Noah

text:And he calls for a man, by the name Velazquez.
Who I am assuming was the best wander that they had.
Because he wasn’t even on the floor
They called for him and Velazquez emerged
From the back offices of the T.S.A.
And he walked out, and the energy changed.

name:Trevor Noah

text:People bowed their heads as he walk past.
Everyone gave him a little nod.
You could see he was special,
and he didn’t look like much.
Velazquez was a little Mexican man.
Very long mustache, big chest.
And he was very short, really, really short guy.

name:Trevor Noah

text:But he didn’t feel short.
He looked short but he didn’t feel
short, do you know what I mean?
Like he had this thing. You know those
short people that are so confident?
It looks like they just chose to grow low.
He had that energy.
And so Velazquez walks down towards
where I am standing with my agent.

name:Trevor Noah

text:My guy tries to apologize, like,
“I don’t know what’s going on”
He silenced him with one move
of his hand like, “No, I go”
He stepped up and looked me in the eye. He’s like, “Sir”
“jibberish”
And I didn’t know what he was saying.
But I knew what he meant.

name:Trevor Noah

text:And so I stood there. I raised my arms.
And as I did, he whipped out his wand.
And he started using it all over me,
And as soon as he did, I knew why he was who he was.
It was the most magical thing I have ever come across in my life.
The way he wielded that wand was unlike
anything I have ever experienced.

name:Trevor Noah

text:I felt like I was being blessed, I
just stood there with my head down.
As he went all over me, just blessing me with his power.
It was something special. It was like a force, an energy.
On the outside you still heard that beeping 
*beeping*
But in my head I heard like a light Sabre, that what I heard.
*sound of a light sabre*

name:Trevor Noah

text:Because he was, he was to me.
A little Mexican Jedi.
In fact that’s exactly what he was, he was my Mexican Jedi.
Which by the way I feel would be a welcome
addition to the Star Wars franchise.
No, I am a big fan, a huge fan of Star Wars. I love Star Wars.
I was super excited when I found out they were
making another one. I was losing my mind.

name:Trevor Noah

text:I went back, watched all the movies.
And I came to realize that there’s no
Mexican Jedi’s. Not even one. There's no Mexican Jedi’s.
Which is weird because when you look at it,
technically speaking. Technically speaking.
Star Wars is a vision of America.
In a distant future.
So

name:Trevor Noah

text:Surely it would be safe to say.
Judging by the current trajectory.
Of Mexican people in America.
I’m sure we would be safe to say by that time.
In a galaxy far, far away.
There would be at least one, just one Mexican Jedi.

name:Trevor Noah

text:It’s not even like it would spoil the story,
Who knows it might open up a whole new avenue.
Can you imagine how different that epic scene
between Luke and Darth could have been?
Them battling it out on the Death Star.
The moment of realization.
*Light Sabre sound*
*heavy breathing* “Luke”

name:Trevor Noah

text:*Light Sabre sound* “what do you want, you evil man!?”
*heavy breathing* “Luke”

Cause all over the world they conform to a norm
and that is in airports women make announcements.
It's always a woman, always.
And she's always calm.
Always monotone.
Always comes over that system, she sits in
a room quietly.

name:Trevor Noah

text:They bring her the pages one by one.
You can be in Heathrow for instance you'll
hear that woman come on the system.
*PA system sound effect*
"Attention all passengers.
Please note this is an airport announcement.
No passengers are permitted to leave any items
unattended as this may be seen as a security risk.

name:Trevor Noah

text:Any unattended luggage will be removed by
security and destroyed.
Thank you."
*PA system turns off*
Everywhere in the world, even if you go to
like non English speaking countries, they
still conform to that norm.
You know you go to places like China where
you wouldn't expect it, you know?

name:Trevor Noah

text:You think and I see some of you probably thinking
there be like, *Stereotypical Chinese jibberish*
No, don't even laugh, that's racist.
Don't even laugh.
Don't, hey!
Don't, no.
That's racist. You don't even laugh.

name:Trevor Noah

text:But they're not.
They're calm.
It's a woman, still the same.
She's just another language she'll come on
the PA like,
*PA system turns on*
"*Calm Chinese jibberish*"

name:Trevor Noah

text:*PA system turns off*
And you know,
you know they've conformed.
And then you land in South Africa.
And you know you've landed, you know that your back
home when you walk into the airport terminal building.
No, no, no.

name:Trevor Noah

text:It's almost like who ever is closest to the
mic gets to do it first, you know?
No, you go do it
It's the craziest thing!
Luckily 99 percent of the time it's a woman
but she'll come on its the craziest thing
ever as your walking she'll come and be like

I don't surf.
I sit on the beach and I enjoy it from there.
It looks beautiful, I enjoy it.

name:Trevor Noah

text:And I'm sitting on the beach in Malibu and
it's during the week so it's really empty.
There's just one girl surfing out there.
California babe and she's rocking it, you
know?
She's got this long blonde hair and tan looking
very fake and just, you know?
She's riding her board and doing her thing
and all those unnecessary surfing moves that
people do, you know?

name:Trevor Noah

text:Just stay here, there's no need for...
And surely, sure enough at the end of it that
she's doing those things and the wave comes
like *Wave crashing sound effect* and I was like,
"You're dead. Dead."
But she wasn't.
She comes out of the water and she's having the time of her life!
And she looks over at me and she's like,

name:Trevor Noah

text:*surfer girl accent* "Heeeeeey there!
Are you like gonna come in?
The water is like super ahhh-mazing!"
I said, "Uh, No. no, Thank you. No, thank you.
I'm just going to sit here.
I'm just going to sit here and watch you.
You're very good. Keep it up, keep it up!"

text:She's like, "O-M-G!
You talk funnyyyy!"
"No I don't talk funny, you talk funny."
"Where are you frommm?"
"I'm from South Africa."
She's like, "Oh, wowww!

name:Trevor Noah

text:Like Africaaa?
How did you get here?"
What?
I used my monkey grip under the plane!
How did you get here?
She doesn't even wait for my answer.

name:Trevor Noah

text:She runs, she's in the water she's doing her thing
and surfing having a good time doing those things.
She comes back out and now all of a sudden
we're best friends.
She runs out onto the beach and she's like,
"Hey, Africaaaa!"
I'm like, "Hey, Americaaaa..."
"So like you don't surf at all?"
I said, "no, I don't. I don't. Where
I'm from we don't really surf."

name:Trevor Noah

text:Johannesburg, there’s no surfers out here,
you know?
She's like, "Aww, that's too baaad.
"Like, do you guys have waves in Africaaaah?"
Do we have waves?
A grown human being asks me if we have waves
on a continent.
Like no, no, we don't, we don't.

name:Trevor Noah

text:Yeah, by the time the water gets to our side of
the world it's just so tired, it's just you know?
It's so worn out from all the traveling.
It tries but it's just
"Aaaaughhh!"
Do we have waves?
She's brilliant she says this and she runs

name:Trevor Noah

text:back into the water.
And every time she goes out there, it's she
comes back more stupid.
It's like...
it's almost like she's fishing for stupidity
out there!
It's almost like there is a shark just like,
"Yeah ask him this now, ask him this! Ask him this!"
Because she comes back and I'll never forget this until
the day I die, I will not forget this conversation.

name:Trevor Noah

text:She comes back onto the beach and she stands next to
me and she's taking off her wet suit and she goes,
"So like, Africaaa,
can I like, ask you a questionnn?"
I said, "Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead."
"If you're like, from Africaaa...
have you like...

name:Trevor Noah

text:ever had AIDS?"
You know what's funny?
Is I wasn't offended by the fact that she
said AIDS...
but I was offended by the fact that she said,
"ever HAD
AIDS".

name:Trevor Noah

text:Like AIDS is something you could've "had" like
a passing flu, you know?
"Hey Jonah, I didn't see you at work last
week Thursday Bro, where were you?"
"Yeah Bro, I had a bit of AIDS there, I just
it hit me hard, eh?
You know, I took some Corenza, now I'm back Bro."
Ever "had"!

that's ravaged by this disease it's my job,
it's my duty to educate people when I meet
them, you know?
It really is a part of who I am, but...
but you know when you look at someone in their
eyes and...
there's no hope?
It's just that old SABC tone just like

So I look at her and I'm like,
"Yes.
Yes, America.

text:I've had AIDS many, many times."
She's like, "Oh wow, reallyyyy?
Oh mah gaaaahd!
So, aren't you gonna be like,
super skinny and dead or somethinggg?"
I said, "No, no, no!
AIDS is not as bad as you think.
It's just like chocolate, you know?

name:Trevor Noah

text:You just shouldn't have too much at one time!
And then you stop for a bit and then after
you're like,
Wooo hoo, more AIDS! you know? You just chill."
She's like, "Wowwww, AIDS are like chocolate?"
I said, "Yeah, yeah! You should try it sometime."

Good evening

text:or not.
Sorry I get nervous when I start a comedy set
I find comedy is very similar to sex for me
Um
Well it is exactly like sex when you think about it, you know...
just me the comedian playing the role of the man

name:Trevor Noah

text:and you the audience the role of the woman
because it my job to satisfy you
and you just have to sit there
and then just like sex my success
or failure is somehow determined by
how much noise you make
during my performance.

name:Trevor Noah

text:You are just faking it now, thank you.
It's a one sided afair.
So I hope you aren’t the quite types
*sound of giggeling'*
No, no, you where great really.

name:Trevor Noah

text:makes it worse when a guy laughs in the middle of it.
It is not meant to be funny.
This is my first time in Australia
and I must say, I'm enjoying it
after two days of traveling to get here
I finally arrived and it is quite a quaint place
it wasn’t supposed to take me that long, we where delayed.

name:Trevor Noah

text:First delay was I got to the airport in Johannesburg
I was on a Quantis flight and they said,
sorry Sir there is a bit of a delay.
I said how long,
they said 24 hours.
I said well that is not a delay, that is cancellation.
I said it is another day, so
they said come back tomorrow.
I came back the next day and we tried it again

name:Trevor Noah

text:and this time we where on the plane
and there was another delay of about 4 to 5 hours
where we are stuck on the tarmac
and the plane couldn’t take off
because the airplane was not balanced.
I have never heard of that in my life.

name:Trevor Noah

text:that is what the pilot said
and like because he is a pilot we
believed him, he just said it.
Because the pilot sounds serious when
they are saying, he came on and he said:
"Ladies and Gentlemen I got a bit of a problem on the plane"
" I don’t kno0w what it going on,
it seems like it is not balanced"
"but we will have to check on what is going on"

name:Trevor Noah

text:"we will get back to you as soon as we know."
Hell of a flight.
As soon as he said that I looked at the fat people
but not in a bad way, not in a bad way
Just in a objective manner, like
hey you guys cant sit together.
You need to sit one, yeah the plane

name:Trevor Noah

text:probably you, it's probably you.
Speaking of fat people, is Biggest
Loser the biggest show in Australia?
That what I see on T.v
the Biggest Loser.
I ,ove that show, it is fantastic
it is always on T.v
What a fantastic show. For those who
don’t know, The Biggest Loser is a show

name:Trevor Noah

text:where they try to help fat people lose weight
through torture basically.
Yes, both emotional and physical
Yeah, the do horrible things like leaving
food in the house that they are living in
then ask them why they are eating it
"Why did you eat the food Kevin,
why did you eat the food?"

name:Trevor Noah

text:because it is there and he is
fat, that is what he does.
This is like his specialty, you know this before he came
why are you now acting shocked?
they should do a show about the people that make
the show and call it "The Biggest Assholes"
that is what they should say.
The show is not helping anybody.

name:Trevor Noah

text:I love it, what an amazing show.
But yes we are flying, so we flew from Johannesburg to Sydney
Sydney you come in and then you have to leave the
airport and then go back into the airport to fly
you go through border control, very friendly I must say
Australia I am very impressed, you
guys have very friendly border control
you guys are very chilled out, very cool

name:Trevor Noah

text:Like visa is not really need, it is but not like
"Do you have your visa?"
No.
"Oh, alright"
You know. I learned the secret to getting through
from a few Chinese men that where ahead of me

name:Trevor Noah

text:is that you just have to irritate the
border police and they just let you in
There was a guy ahead of
me and the woman asked him
"Excuse me Sir, where are you staying
in Australia, where are you staying?
He went, "Kangaroo, kangaroo!"
"No Sir, where are you staying?"
"Kangaroo, kangaroo!"

name:Trevor Noah

text:"No Sir, you cant, where are you
going to be staying? How long?"
"Kangaroo, kangaroo!"
She is like, "Okay, just
go in, just go in."
and he just came in and he was like
It was fantastic, it was fantastic.
Yes and he had this look when
he got to the other side like

name:Trevor Noah

text:It works every time, you know.
He had this knowing look about him
So we, you come in
and it seems too easy, because it is
because the border control is very chilled
but then you get to the customs

name:Trevor Noah

text:which is the most hardcore place in the world.
I don’t know what happened in Australia but
you guys need to chill out when it comes to fruit.
People are standing there being strip-searched
"Where did you get the apple!"
"I don’t care if you cant speak English, you
gonna spend a week in quarantine mate!"
"Where did you get the apple?!"

name:Trevor Noah

text:"I don’t care, I don’t care!
Where is the apple from?"
You see people, there was a
guy that got stopped for weed
He's like: "Is that meruana?
don’t do it again"
"but you with the apple, back
to where you came from!"
What did fruit do to your country?
It is such a weird place getting used to
Australia, because you finally come in

name:Trevor Noah

text:and then you cant understand anybody,
you really really cant because
because you guys say you speak English but it's not
it is like you try but then I could not tell
because sometimes it actually sounds like Chinese
I used to hear people making jokes about
Oh there are all all these Chinese people
but then when you come you don’t know if
the Australians are Chinese or not Chinese

name:Trevor Noah

text:because it sounds the same to me
especially like a very deep
Australian accent is very, like people say
*Chinesse jibberish*
Oh yeah, Shushini, shushini
No, I don’t know what is going on here man.
This is very
and then the phrases that I do understand don’t make sense

name:Trevor Noah

text:like positive phrases. Like apparently
apparently she'll be right.
I don’t know who she is
and how she applies to me
but this is very important to say in Australia.
You also feel it is very important to
tell everybody that you have no worries.
Yes, I did not ask you about your life philosophy

name:Trevor Noah

text:I just asked you how you where on the day
"No worries, no worries."
Really not even one, not even one worry?
Really in Australia, are things that good here?
not even one worry, not even prostate cancer?
not even one, not even North Korea?

name:Trevor Noah

text:because those guys are close, I am just saying.
Not even one worry?
Yeah, yeah.
and the strangest one, and this is something I have learned
that you should teach people before they come is
The correct answer to the phrase, "How you going"
Is not, "By airplane."

name:Trevor Noah

text:I feel it is strange asking people this while they are traveling
I was flying, we where in Sydney
going to Melbourne and I got to the counter
I said to the woman: "hi I am going to Melbourne please"
and she said: "Oh yeah, how you going?"
and I said: "by airplane."

name:Trevor Noah

text:that is why I have chosen this building over here
to be traveling in.
and she said no, I was greeting you.
and I said: "oh, no worries."
You guys have been great, thanks for having me.
This is so amazing, so many of you here,
to see me.. huh!?

name:Trevor Noah

text:That was like the most amazing
experience. I didn't know that the Royal Wedding

she doesn't even know him!
Doesn't matter...
It shows that her family is unconventional.
I'm not gonna lie... I was
glad that it was the white side of Meghan's family
That was a.... I'm not gonna lie...
I'm....

name:Trevor Noah

text:We could not handle that as black people!
That is the last thing we needed!
Can you imagine if that was the
black side of the family?? Really!?
If Megan's dad was on TV and he was like....
Oh noooo, I'm not coming to their wedding.
Noooo!

name:Trevor Noah

text:Here we see Meghan's father posing for photos....
Ahh you caught me again... oh
no, you have caught me! ahhh!
Black people would have never...
Cause that's the hard thing
about being a minority... whether you're black...
whether you're in your... whether you...
you know whether you're Arabic...
whatever it is... like if you're a minority...
if you if you have a certain skin tone...

name:Trevor Noah

text:you know that every action you commit,
every action you commit, like.... taints your
whole... your family. It taints your
everything! White people are individuals...
that's white people... that's like the best
thing in the world!
That's what white privilege means to me, you're an individual...
Let's look at Dave... he is excellent!
He's a mass murderer!!

So much stress.
So I was glad... I was glad...

name:Trevor Noah

text:Like her mom was there... uh no, fly...
looking beautiful as well!
The wedding went off without a hitch...
And my favorite thing was how like...
how like, the British media talked about...
How black the event was...
and they weren't... I understand and here's the thing...
This is like one of those things,
where I understand... like, they want to talk about it...

name:Trevor Noah

text:because you're not used to
having like a black wedding, right?!
And so like everyone today... I'd had like CNN...
contacted me and they're like... Trevor!
Would you mind speaking about...umm..The
wedding.. and, and rarely all the black performers?!
There was a black cellist...
and, there was a black choir...
and a black Pastor!

name:Trevor Noah

text:How do you feel??
Black?!?
I don't know how I'm supposed to feel...
What are you...
How do you respond to that question?!
How do you feel about...
I don't know how I feel, it's a wedding!

name:Trevor Noah

text:I don't know... what do you want me
to say?

I wasn't watching that wedding being like...
Whoa that's black!
So much black...
Another one!
It's a wedding...

name:Trevor Noah

text:what do you want me to say... It's people!
And also... I feel like people go too far, like you
know that's where you realize that
there's enough.... there's not enough like
diversity in your world. Is if you think
that... THAT made it a black wedding!!
Let me tell you something...
A black cellist... has canceled itself out!

name:Trevor Noah

text:If have a black person playing the cello...
It's safe to say, that you've canceled
out the blackness of that event!
That's the safest way to introduce blackness into your family...
Daddy!! I'm dating a black man!!
What?!?
He plays the cello!

name:Trevor Noah

text:Alright, bring him in, bring him in!
Even white people think a cello is white.
You walk in with a cello?! White people are also like...
What the hell is that man?
like it was a black wedding... It wasn't a black...
It was just a wedding!
It was a beautiful, beautiful
wedding!

text:If it was a real black wedding, it wouldn't have ended!
That's a REAL black wedding!
It would NEVER end!
If it was a real black wedding... Prince's Nigerian Uncle...
You would've found like Harry's Nigerian Uncle
He would have been in the carriage

included black people, that's all it was.
And it was beautiful.
It was beautiful to see...
All the celebrities showing up.
All the famous people... they
sang God Save The....
I never noticed... that when they sing God
Save The Queen... The Queen doesn't sing.

name:Trevor Noah

text:which I understand... I mean, I feel like
that would be a little bit weird
Like she knows... like which is... like that's
what I like about the Queen, I'm not gonna front
Like she has a gangster vibe about her.
Like... she's gotten to that point where she's like...
Yeah I'm the Queen, I'm over it! Let's keep it moving...
She doesn't act like someone who's the Queen anymore...
She's just like I'm over it... I'm the Queen!

name:Trevor Noah

text:And so everyone standing there like God, (gibberish)
She's like... yeah yeah, I know, I know... Save Me, I know!
I'm not going to sing it for myself!
Can't be like.... Saaa, aaaa, aaaaave, me!
I don't need you assholes to save me!
I drive myself!

name:Trevor Noah

text:Ha ha ha ha
It was such a beautiful day... every single piece of it.
It was wonderful, seeing the people in the streets...
Everyone had a smile on their face...
You know, everyone was happy!
Cause like Harry's popular! He's popular in
southern Africa. He's popular in the UK

name:Trevor Noah

text:He's got that cool vibe about him... you
know Meghan Markle as well... has inspired people
The only weird thing in the wedding for me was...
they had a black Pastor.
African Pastor, and...
and.... This was like... It was weird in a good way!
He started giving a sermon...
And he started talking about Martin Luther King.

name:Trevor Noah

text:And then he started talking about slavery.
And I could see, in that moment...
There were people in the audience who were like...
God Save The Queen! God Save The Queen!
Somebody STOP this man! God Save The
Queen!
That is why Jacob has been different because
because a lot of people panic in
South Africa, they panic you know

name:Trevor Noah

text:when it comes to our politicians because of this.
They just don’t understand them
Especially around election time, that is when
you see the most panic in South Africa.
It has always been the case
for our first democratic election in 1994
Remember that?
Nelson Mandela was about to become president

name:Trevor Noah

text:most of the country was over joyed, a few people where worried.
you heard them whispering
"I am leaving, I am leaving!"
"I am going to Australia Mary."
"I am going, it has been fun
but it is time to go hey?"
"because you know now they are going
to take over, it is time to go."

name:Trevor Noah

text:"I am leaving, I am going to Australia."
Then Nelson Mandela became president
and they all stayed.
"He is a wonderful man!
Wonder full man, ah!"
"If it was not for him I would have left."
"Wonderful man, he is amazing yeah"

name:Trevor Noah

text:"He is really great, I love him.
He is amazing."
You thought they where over it but
next elections people panicked again.
Thabo Mbeki about to become president and people lost it.
"I am leaving, I am going to
Australia Mary. I am going."
"This time I am going. You know that now that
Mandela is gone they are going to eat us hey?"
"It is only a matter of time"

name:Trevor Noah

text:"I am leaving, I am going to Australia!"
But once again, Thabo became president
and they all stayed.
He left.
No shame, no no shame.
Then we had Kgalema Motlanthe, wasn’t that crazy?

name:Trevor Noah

text:Kgalema Motlantheeeee
He is like our interim president,
didn’t want to touch anything.
He was that guy, hey?
No one knew what to get of him, it was just like crazy
and they lost their minds even worse.
"I cant believe it!
I didn’t even vote!

name:Trevor Noah

text:"I didn’t even vote!"
"What the hell!
One minute I go to PEP"
"and Thabo Mbeki is our president"
"and the next thing you know,
I wake up and we have"
"Kgalema Mmmmglanti!
I cant believe it!"
"I am going to Australia, I am going!"

name:Trevor Noah

text:But then once again thankfully they stayed,
and then it got interesting
because it was the turn of Jacob Zuma.
OOOOHHH
The original boogeyman.
People panicked again, although it was different

name:Trevor Noah

text:for the first time in South African
history you heard black people going
"Eish!"
"How much is that ticket to Australia again?"
Jacob knew he had to go
big, go big or go home
he knew there was only one way from
where he was and that was down
Jacob was like, "They will remember me"

name:Trevor Noah

text:"One way or another"
"Mandela might be the father of the nation
but I will be the father of a nation
I wanted Jacob to be a mad man, I
wanted him to be totally crazy you know?
I wanted him to not give damn, walk into parliament
4 hours late, his top undone, belly hanging out

strong and powerful you know?
Jacob Zuma, thew spear.
The symbol of the Zulu nation for hundreds of years

______________________.
The spear of the nation,

It is not like that guy called it 
"The pocketknife"
The Spear, big and manly.

name:Trevor Noah

text:That is why our president didn’t complain,
Jacob Zuma did not complain once
because he understands art, he is cultured.
The guys around him complaining on his behalf
I hate it when people do that, he was not even offended
they ran to him like little kids tattle taliing.
"Jacob!"
"Jacob!"

name:Trevor Noah

"What happened now?"
"Jacob, it is disgusting!
It is disgusting!"
"Did you see what they did? They painted you, they painted you!"

text:"No sorry, they painted a picture of you"
"They painted a picture of you, just show him the picture!
just show him the picture!"

picture and they showed it to him

He probably didn’t even see
anything and was just like
"I don’t see"

text:big mistake.
Never bring money up around Jacob, ever.
Look, because I don’t know if you have noticed.
Our president admits to money
there is always money around him but it is never his.
Always, oh it is the Sheiks money,
it is the Gupta’s money,

"Ha, ha mustache"

back in our faces.

text:Who is this guy?
Huh?
He is just shrugging it off, evading
maneuvering
Never mind the Ngandla joke, I love
the fact that he rolled his eyes.
that blew my mind, I have never seen Jacob Zuma do that

name:Trevor Noah

text:He looked over and was just like
*rolling his eyes*
When did Jacob Zuma start rolling his eyes?
That is not something he does, Jacob
Zuma does not roll his eyes guys
In fact, presidents don’t roll their eyes
it is not a very presidential thing to do

name:Trevor Noah

text:in parliament, to roll your eyes
at the position. Even the most deviant rulers in the world
don’t roll their eyes.
When the UN is telling the leader of North Korea
to stop making nuclear weapons
you don’t see Kim Jong-un going,

name:Trevor Noah

text:"Ag, whatever!"
You don’t roll your eyes.
Jacob Zuma did
and he did it in style, I want to know where he learned it
how he learned it, has he been doing it for a while?
because rolling your eyes is part of an attitude

name:Trevor Noah

text:you don’t just roll your eyes, if you
roll your eyes you got that sass
you are bitchy, you know?
is he doing more than that?
Now I see Jacob Zuma in a totally different light,
now I am picturing him hanging outwith the rest of
the ANC comrades chatting about these problems
"Mr. President I want to know where is the money Mr. President

name:Trevor Noah

text:"where did the money go?"
and he is like,
"Really guys?"
"over and over they keep asking me"
"I mean literally, I am tired now"
"like, cant they get over it"
"like that Musi guy, get a life already"

name:Trevor Noah

text:"just because you hang with white chicks, I mean"
"Please"
"Whatever"
Is that what he is doing?
and if he is, where did he learn that?
Where do you learn to roll your eyes at
that age, that is what I want to know.

name:Trevor Noah

text:It is not your friends, it is not your colleagues.
It is probably your kids, yea
you learn bad habits at home.
Jacob Zuma probably learned it from
one of his children in the house.
one of his daughters maybe
she was going out for a night with her friends
caught her as she was leaving.

name:Trevor Noah

text:"Hey, where are you going?"
"where are you going dressed like that?"
"Dad, I told you I am going out with my friends.
I am going to a party"
"First off all, you are already in a party"
"Secondly, no daughter of mine will dress like that"
"go and change!"

name:Trevor Noah

text:"Dad, what are doing?
You are killing me"
"come on, why are you doing this. I can
dress however I want, I am old enough."
"Hey, you will do as I say"
"as long as you are living under my roofs"
"which I have paid for with other people's money"
"you will obey me, go and change!"

name:Trevor Noah

text:"Dad, come on. Why are you doing this
"everyone else dress like this, all the other kids do it"
"are all the other kids my children?"
"You never know."
"Huh, what are you doing.'
"Don't come in this house with that DA attitude"

name:Trevor Noah

text:"go and change, now!"
"Ag, whatever!"
"What was that?"
"what did you just do?"
"I didn’t do anything daddy"
"Don't lie to me, I saw it."

name:Trevor Noah

text:"you did something with your eyes"
"it looked like The Undertaker"
"but they came back, what was that?"
"I just..."
"I just rolled my eyes dad."
"That made me feel so insignificant."

name:Trevor Noah

text:"What you did there made me feel like you did not
acknowledge the seriousness of this situation."
"Can you teach me how to do that?"
"Yeah, like..."
"It's easy, you just roll your eyes like"
"if someone says something you
don’t like you just go like"
"Ah, whatever"

name:Trevor Noah

text:"Ah, whatever"
"Wow, wow dad. That is too much"
"you have just got to loosen up and be like
Ah, whatever"
"Ag, whatever"
"I think I got it."
"No you don’t have it dad, you are rolling your head"

name:Trevor Noah

text:"you are supposed to roll your eyes."
"and my eyes are where?"
"exactly"
and he was off
ready to roll baby.
and he did, he rolled straight into parliament.

name:Trevor Noah

text:Shut it down.
Turned Ngandla into a joke, you
Ngandla up anymore. It is over now.
You say Ngandla in parliament
and people laugh at you.
Yeah, immediately.
"and what about Ngandla"
It's done.
it's done.

name:Trevor Noah

text:Just, you know.
I love it so much, you know what I
love most about the Ngandla thing?
a lot of people do not realize this.
Jacob Zuma was making a joke out of Ngandla, yes.
but what was more interesting to me was the fact
that he was mocking Vusi Mangmani, the leader of the DA.

name:Trevor Noah

text:A lot of people did not pick this up.
When he is doing the whole "Ngandla"
He is mocking Vusi Mangmani's model C English accent.
That is what he is doing.
Jacob Zuma thinks that he speaks funny.
*Laughter*

name:Trevor Noah

text:That is priceless.
Jacob Zuma is sitting in parliament
watching Vusi Mangmani speak
like, "I would like to know about the allocation of funds"
"more especially regarding"
"the homestead at Mgandla and whether.."
and he is like,
*Zuma laughing*

name:Trevor Noah

text:"This guy talk so funny"
*Zuma laughing*
"Ngandla"
"Ngandla, would you like some tea with your crumpets?"
"mash, mash, mash, mash"
"mash, mash, mash, mash-mellow"

name:Trevor Noah

text:Jacob Zuma is just laughing at him, that’s just beautiful.
I don’t know how much of it is true or not
what I do know is
If Jacob Zuma was allowing the Gupta’s to
control our country and choose our ministers
then it was not my president being corrupt to me
it was the Gupta’s telling him what to do

name:Trevor Noah

text:It is like Julius said
"The Gupta’s where in his ear all along"
"They where inside his ear all along"
and you know the way Julius sounded, it sounded amazing because
Like I get the phrase when they go they where in his ear
but he said they where inside his ear.

name:Trevor Noah

text:It sounded like the Gupta’s where actually inside
Jacob Zuma's ear.
when actually would have made sense if you think about it.
what if they where inside his ear the entire time?
how do we know that every single time
Jacob Zuma was speaking to us as a nation
he was actually telling us
what the Gupta’s was saying

name:Trevor Noah

text:like he had one of those
earpieces that they have
on those hidden camera shows
like he was there in parliament 
outside parliament
there was a van with a
Gupta sitting inside of it
*tapping on microphone*

trying to listen to you while also speaking
we understand Jacob but you know we
have already made a plan you and us
so repeat everything that I say okay
okay I will repeat everything
and that is probably why things went wrong.

name:Trevor Noah

text:because I don’t know if you’ve ever tried to
listen to someone while talking to someone else
your mind jams
Jacob Zuma could never deliver a speech
its not that he couldn’t read 
He couldn’t listen
he couldn’t listen and speak at the same time
I used to watch him and think
what’s going on Jacob?

name:Trevor Noah

text:YouTube is buffering
 What’s happening here?
this is why data must fall
but it turns out he was just
listening the entire time

I went straight into it, watching the vote of no confidence
I was so stressed.
I don’t know about you, but I was so stressed.
I was like please, please, please

name:Trevor Noah

text:don’t let Zuma go, please.
Don't let Zuma go, my jokes.
All of my jokes.
Please1!
I did go to Zambia though.
Fantastic place Zambia.
Went there, visited the
place and had a good time.

name:Trevor Noah

text:While I was there I had a chaperone
who really made my trip.
His name was Alinani, sweet guy.
And his job was to get me
accustomed to the Zambian culture.
And every day he would give me a new piece of
information, some more interesting than others.
Like one day he looks at me and goes,
“Trevor, you know Zambia is a
very, very conservative nation."

name:Trevor Noah

text:I said, “Oh, okay Ali.
He says, “Yea, so please stay away from profanity.”
And I said I can do that, I assumed he meant swearing.
But I didn’t say anything because I wasn’t
sure if he meant a person or swearing.
No, no, because in Zambia people have names like Profanity.
So, that’s how I laughed when I met Screwdriver.
It’s the same way I laughed.

name:Trevor Noah

text:Yea, because you see
In South Africa we have African names you can translate.
Like Happiness, Blessing and Hope. Those kinds of names.
But then in Zambia
People give their names, like they give their children names
of everyday English words, anything.

name:Trevor Noah

text:So like, table, chair, car, house.
You see, like you just have to get used to it.
It’s very hard, but you have
to keep a straight face.
Which was difficult because I met a mechanic,
who had sons named Brake and Clutch.
And that was not, especially when Brake
was running around causing chaos.
And his dad was there like, “stop it Brake,
stop it Brake, stop it, stop it Brake.

name:Trevor Noah

text:And I was like, “Hey, stop it Brake. Ha Ha.”
But you have to get used to it, it’s a cultural thing.
And so, you have to respect it.
And the second warning Ali gave me, was even stranger.
We are driving thru Lusaka, the capital.
And Ali looks over at me in the car and goes,

name:Trevor Noah

text:“Trevor, you know here in Zambia
we are a very God loving nation.”
I said, “Oh, okay Ali. That’s
a good thing to know.”
He says, “Yes, so while you are here don’t be gay.”
I said, “What?”
He says, “I know it can be tempting
sometimes but don’t do it.”
“Don’t be gay.”

name:Trevor Noah

text:“Don’t be gay?”
I have never been warned of this in my life, don’t be gay?
“Hey bru, don’t be gay. Don’t be gay.”
“Don’t be gay?”
Crazy, crazy warning to get.
But then I found out why Ali was warning me.

name:Trevor Noah

text:Turns out in Zambia being gay is illegal.
If you are found to be gay
you will be arrested and sent to prison
for more than thirty years, yea.
Which is a bit of a weird punishment.
When you think about it.

name:Trevor Noah

text:I mean I am not saying that gay guys would enjoy prison,
I am just saying if I was gay
That’s not the worst thing
you could do to me.
They would be like, “you
are going to jail!”
I would be like, “Oh no.”
Don’t be gay?

name:Trevor Noah

text:I couldn’t believe this, gay is a crime in Zambia.
Which got me thinking. If gay is a crime,
that means the police have to monitor it.
They actually have to police gay. Yeah.
Which means in their police force, they have a gay division.
It’s a crime, it’s a crime.
So that means they have a murder unit, a
robbery unit, a white collar crimes unit.

name:Trevor Noah

text:And then they got a gay unit.
Yea, they have got a little G unit in their police force.
That’s responsible for all things gay.
That must be the most fun police
force to be in, in the world.
You get to go under cover, dress up really nice.
Get in touch with your flamboyant
side, have a good time.

name:Trevor Noah

text:I bet the sergeant’s there every
morning, briefing his detectives.
“Good morning Detectives.”
“Welcome everybody, today we will
be launching a sting operation.”
“We have just been informed of a fashion
show that will be taking place.”
“And as you know, the gays cannot
resist the latest fashion trends.”
“Therefore we will be in full attendance
to apprehend each and every one of them.”

name:Trevor Noah

text:“Let us make sure we are here.”
“Detective Chepoa?”
“Present!”
“Detective Table?”
“Present!”
“Detective Mongai?”

name:Trevor Noah

text:“Present!”
“I think he's in too deep.”
How do you police gay?
Do they stop you if you look suspiciously gay in the streets?
I mean, gay doesn’t have a look. But maybe you
have a bounce about you, like a bit of pizazz.
Do the police pull up there and is like,

name:Trevor Noah

text:*police siren*
“You, over there!”
“What is the purpose of that flamboyant scarf?”
“Put your hands up!”
“Turn around! Don’t tempt
me, don’t tempt me!”
“You are going to jail.”
How do you police gay?

name:Trevor Noah

text:Do they have roadblocks?
Like for drunk driving?
Do they have gay roadblocks?
They are just like stopping people in they’re cars.
“Good evening Officer”
“Good evening Sir”
“License Please?”

name:Trevor Noah

text:“Thank you very much, Mr. Stylish. Hey?”
“Tell me Sir, have you been gay this evening?”
“No, I have not been gay. In fact, I don’t gay at all.”
“I see, not even one or two?”
“No, No. No gays for me. No gays for me.”
“Okay”

name:Trevor Noah

text:“Then tell me Sir.”
*sniffing*
“What is that I can smell on your breath?”
“Is that balls?”
“No, no, no, I”
“I don’t even eat Chutney, No”
“A ha”

name:Trevor Noah

text:“So you are not gay?”
“No, not gay at all”
“Then Sir, can you please blow into this?”
Ahh
Don’t be gay.
I was not gay while I was in Zambia, so I had a good time.

name:Trevor Noah

text:Went around and saw the people.
The highlight of my trip
came when on my day off
I asked Ali for suggestions.
Ali said to me, “Maybe you should travel
around Lusaka, meet some of the people”
“just have a good time.”
I said to Ali I want to do something special.

name:Trevor Noah

text:He said, “Oh well, in that case”
“Maybe you can go to the Mall and if you are lucky”
“maybe you can ride the escalators.”
I said, “What?”
“Hey, I am not promising anything”
“but if you are early, maybe you can go once or twice.”

name:Trevor Noah

text:I said, “Escalators?”
“I know, mind-blowing ha?”
I thought he was messing with me.
Until I found out people in Zambia go to the mall
just to ride the escalators.
It seems ridiculous until you understand the back-story.

name:Trevor Noah

text:When we were in Zambia there were
only five public escalators.
Five, in the whole country.
The first escalator was built in August.
Not August 19??
No, no. You remember August. Past August?
They built they’re first escalators, ever.

name:Trevor Noah

text:Yea, and so now it is all the rage. People
go to the Mall just to ride escalators.
But now, I don’t want you to
picture some dusty village.
That’s not what Zambia is,
it’s a beautiful place.
They are developing just as we are, they have roads.
They got airports, the have beautiful hotels.
Stunning shopping Malls.

name:Trevor Noah

text:They’ve got everything we
got, even faster internet
The have just never had escalators.
And now they started building them.
And because of that people go there, and
they just spend a day riding escalators.
Yea, Dads will go home and fetch their children.
“Children, we are going to the Mall.”

name:Trevor Noah

text:“To do what Daddy?”
“To do shopping, and to ride the escalators!”
“Yay!”
We couldn’t believe this so
we went to the Mall, right.
We get to the Mall. The Mall is empty.
Escalators are packed!

name:Trevor Noah

text:People are standing in lines going
around, doubling back on themselves.
There’s old people, young people, even couples.
There were couples. Guys that
actually picked up woman by saying:
“I am going to take you to the escalator girl.”
“Oh, you are so fancy hey?”
Escalators. Some people didn’t even
know how to ride the escalators.

name:Trevor Noah

text:Kids were easy, they just jumped on. Old people would panic.
There was one guy who got on the escalator, and it was going up.
And I guess to compensate for
something in his mind, as it went up
He started leaning.
He fell down!
Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha.
He fell down!
Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha.

name:Trevor Noah

text:Oh, it was fantastic to watch.
We spent like three hours doing this,
watching people riding escalators.
And you know what? Our patience paid off, because
in hour three the most fantastic thing happened.
A school brought a class of children to the Mall.
And their excursion was just to ride the escalators.
It was magic.

name:Trevor Noah

text:Thirty kids, about five years old. Cutest things,
they were in their black and white uniforms.
And they are standing there together holding hands.
And they were so excited, they were shining.
Not from excitement, that Vaseline.
And there is two teachers with the children,
and they grab their hands on either end.
And as they do the start singing at the
top of their lungs like little angels.

name:Trevor Noah

text:“Escalator”
“Escalator”
“Escalator”
“Oh, Oh, Ohhhhhhoh Escalator”
“Escalator”
It was the sweetest thing ever.

name:Trevor Noah

text:People are waving at them, smiling.
And these kids see the escalators.
And they lost, their minds.
These kids went crazy.
They’re not holding hands, they
start screaming and running around.
It looked like a zombie movie, or something.

name:Trevor Noah

text:They are jumping, but then you see the smiles on their faces.
It’s like the end of Saraphina. You are
like, “What the hell is going on here?”
These kids are screaming. They are
jumping around doing cartwheels.
The teacher can’t control them.
She’s panicking like,
“Hey! Get back! Get Back!”
“Two-by-two! Two-by-two!”

name:Trevor Noah

text:Two-by two was one of the
kids, I didn’t know.
She’s like, “Two-by-Two! Next to
me, next to me! Single file, single file!”
Other kids are still jumping, she can’t control them.
There was one fat kid. He couldn’t
jump so he just shook himself.
“Escalator!”
“Escalator!”

name:Trevor Noah

text:It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my life.
It's like I had gone in a time machine
to a time when escalators were new.
Brand new
and popular
So popular...

using their iPhones!

any questions before we move on anything
bugging you yes right yes right right
well it's a little bit better in South
Africa with apartheid but yes why that's

name:Trevor Noah

text:that's a tough thing I mean that there's
so many layers to that question look I
don't know how they will I think how
they should is easy I think history
should just be told from many different
perspectives people need to understand

name:Trevor Noah

text:that a lot of the time it's not that
you're a bad person it's just that we
think of a story from our perspective
because we are the ones telling it do
you get I'm saying so a good example is
I remember when I was in South Africa

name:Trevor Noah

text:and I'd learn about the the history of
the British and because the British were
kicked out of South Africa and because
like the Afrikaners and the Zulus fought
against them the history I was taught
was that the British were invaders they

name:Trevor Noah

text:were bad and they came in and they shot
the people and they did you get them
saying but then when you go to England
they tell you about the heroes the
heroes who fought in the Zulu War and
how they triumphed and then it's like

name:Trevor Noah

text:what do you mean here heroes they had
guns and other people didn't have guns
that's not a war that's that's just
shooting people do you know what I mean
and then and then and British people
genuinely were like oh I never thought

name:Trevor Noah

text:of it like that Trevor
and in their defense they were like
that's that's just how we were taught we
were taught they were heroes and if you
were taught that somebody's a hero
you're gonna believe that they're here I

name:Trevor Noah

text:just think every story in America should
be told from all different perspectives
it's as simple as that as for the racial
props and the hearings that was probably
one of my favorite moments in TV and in
in us in a hearing ever because for

name:Trevor Noah

text:those who didn't see it was Michael
Cohen testifying and then what happened
was one of the congressmen brought out a
friend of the Trump family and he was
like you say the Trump's are racist but
look at that black friend look at her

name:Trevor Noah

text:look at her that black friend and then
receded sleeve she was like that's
racist bringing out a black person as a
prop is racist and he was like how dare
you say that I'm racist I have black
nieces and nephews and I was like okay I

name:Trevor Noah

text:don't know that that means you're not
racist that just means that your brother
has had sex with a person who's someone
of color that's all that means because
you can't be like it's not like a you're
like children he's just like my nephews

name:Trevor Noah

text:and yeah that means you have black
people in your family doesn't mean
you're not like people choose weird
things to display that they're not
racist and then I think it was was a
Cummings was Elijah Cummings who then

name:Trevor Noah

text:stepped in and then he was like actually
as a black man and I can let you know
that this white man is not racist and
he's my friend and then I was like this

would Jesse Simone that do something
like this why does an act to do anything
driven wait hold on let me do that again
why do actors do anything driver that
was it use that one

name:Trevor Noah

text:use only I don't know why he did it man
I mean if you wanted to raise awareness
for LGBTQ rights he should have just
donated money if you wanted attention he
could have just leaked his nudes and if
you wanted to hang out with two guys at

text:2:00 a.m.
Grindr is right there okay but but
here's what I'm worried about though
won't won't this make it harder for
victims of real hate crimes to come
forward and get justice not really

name:Trevor Noah

text:because that would have required people
to have cared about queer people
specifically queer black people in the
first place well Mookie that's a strong
statement I think most people do care
Trevor you clearly haven't heard of the

name:Trevor Noah

text:gay trans panic defense it's a totally
admissible legal defense where someone
can get a lighter sentence for killing a
gay or trans person by claiming the
victim hit on them are you being serious
yes no in 47 states including New York

name:Trevor Noah

text:someone could beat a gay person like me
to death and then go well I don't know
he wanted to suck my dick and you know
what maybe I did but that's still not a
good reason you know I mean imagine if
women could use that defense there be no

name:Trevor Noah

text:men let's
I don't know who would be left to buy
all the three in one body wash shampoo
and conditioner some of us are busy we
don't have time for lots of products
okay but but anyway this is this is

name:Trevor Noah

text:obviously unfortunate on so many levels
what is your takeaway going forward
honestly Trevor I think that this is a
teaching moment for us all and
personally I've learned one really
valuable lesson which is that actors

name:Trevor Noah

text:should not write their own projects I
mean this thing had way too many plot
holes he totally missed cast villains I
mean two Nigerian Trump supporters like
you can't just cast black people as
racist white people this isn't Hamilton

president Trump's border wall it was his
number one campaign promise
but now Trump can't find anyone willing
to pay for it
Mexico refused to pay for it Congress

name:Trevor Noah

text:refused to pay for it he tried to put it
on Jared's credit card but couldn't
figure out how the chip works I was like
sir you're pulling it out too soon he's
like well I don't know if this machine
is on the pill I'm not getting trapped

name:Trevor Noah

text:again I don't want another Eric and so
on Friday on Friday the president had no
other choice but to take emergency
action in the Rose Garden the president
did what he had long threatened to do
declaring a national emergency to get

name:Trevor Noah

give him to build his border wall now
the battle moves to the courts with
challenges coming from border states
landowners and others and they're
already pointing to this stunning

name:Trevor Noah

text:admission I didn't need to do this but
I'd rather do it much faster wait hold
up
so Trump admitted he didn't need to
declare an emergency he's just doing it
to save time that sort of negates his

name:Trevor Noah

text:entire argument it would be like a pilot
coming out of the cockpit with a
parachute saying look I don't have to
open the emergency door but we're right
over my house and I don't want to fight
traffic thank you for flying spirit

name:Trevor Noah

text:airline
but look you can argue about it but
Trump clearly thinks that Mexicans
coming over the border is a national
emergency and so in response America has
to build a wall which is a very gradual

name:Trevor Noah

text:response to an emergency this is like
sir they're invading should we mobilize
our tanks and call in air strikes no no
no premier finest bricklayers in three
to five years they'll regret invading us
so look Trump knows that this isn't the

name:Trevor Noah

text:end of the border war fights right
because it's a national emergency
this declaration will be challenged in
the courts and we know he knows this
because he wrote a song about it
we will have a national emergency and we

name:Trevor Noah

text:will then be sued and they will sue us
in the Ninth Circuit even though it
shouldn't be there and we will possibly
get a bad ruling and then we'll get
another bad ruling and then we'll end up
in the Supreme Court and hopefully we'll

name:Trevor Noah

text:get a fair shake and we'll win in the
Supreme Court just like the ban they
sued us in the ninth circuit and we lost
and then we lost in the Appellate
Division and then we went to the Supreme
Court and we won ok that was super weird

name:Trevor Noah

text:why are you talking like that it sounds
like he's being auto-tuned but it's very
addictive I don't think I can stop now
somebody help me but but as crazy as his
delivery was I think we should at least
be thankful that he used it to talk

name:Trevor Noah

text:about the wall and not like a natural
disaster
imagine if he whipped that out for the
first time after like a giant earthquake
who like there was this big earthquake
lots of people were trapped we're gonna

surprisingly surprisingly car Dedes jam

sense it really does it makes sense
which made me think what if the whole
time the keys are making Trump is
smarter president is to just teach him
in song form

name:Trevor Noah

text:maybe that's why he doesn't retain
information his advisers she'd do this
the next time they have to explain
anything to Trump they should be like

it didn't even sound like Trump was

declaration an unconstitutional power
grab because only Congress should decide
how to appropriate money and while Trump
now thinks that executive action is the

I'll make great deals and we'll get them
done and we don't have to use executive
orders and all this stuff that Obama is
using we're not going to be opening our
borders or closing our borders based on

name:Trevor Noah

text:executive orders you get a bit of room
but you make it heal mm-hmm but
certainly he has not been able to do
that and now he has to use executive
action and it's a very very dangerous
thing the whole concept of executive

supposed to be run you're supposed to go

go and talk to people and get the guys

if you wanted highlights last night's

name:Trevor Noah

text:the djt ratings machine had you covered
because he was also in El Paso pushing
for the wall
although the timing was a bit weird
because you see just before the rally
started news broke that Congress had

name:Trevor Noah

text:reached a bipartisan deal to give Trump
one point three seven billion dollars in
funding for a border war or some type of
barrier and I mean that is nice for
Trump that he got something although if
you've been paying attention you realize

name:Trevor Noah

text:it's actually 200 million dollars less
then Congress was ready to give him
before the shutdown out of the deal
never Trump didn't care about all that
he was too excited about his rally to
worry about these stupid details I have

name:Trevor Noah

text:to tell you as I was walking up to the
stage
they said that progress is being made
with this committee so maybe
progressives it maybe not but I had a
choice I could have stayed out there and

name:Trevor Noah

text:listened or I could have come out to the
people of El Paso and Texas I chose
just now I said wait a minute
I gotta take care of my people from
Texas I got to go I don't even want to
hear about it did he just turn into Bill

name:Trevor Noah

text:Cosby there what was that but that was a
pretty insane admission right President
Trump is saying instead of getting
informed and then passing that
information on to his audience he'd
prefer to just get them riled up like

name:Trevor Noah

text:that's what he wants he's like they gave
me and I was like I don't need it I want
to go talk to the people thank God Trump
is president and not my doctor like the
nurses wanted to show me a chart of your
diagnosis but I'd have time for that

name:Trevor Noah

text:time to slice and dice I have this
Freddy Krueger glug I got from the TSA
so the truth is Trump was just in rally
mode right he didn't care about the
facts and the figures in fact he was so
excited because he was going to release

name:Trevor Noah

text:his remix to build the wall
[Applause]
now you really mean finish that wall
because we built a lot of it's pretty
slow they built a lot of it wait what so
now we're doing finish the wall I don't

name:Trevor Noah

text:know how much actual work they're doing
on the border but I guess in Trump's
chant world they're making a lot of
progress yeah build our wall finish the
wall cool we built the wall build
another wall on top of the old wall

name:Trevor Noah

text:double-decker wall now to be fair to
Trump
even though 0 new miles of wall have
been built under Trump when he says
we've built a lot of wall Trump is
talking about how he's upgraded some of

name:Trevor Noah

text:the existing fencing into taller fencing
yeah so he solved the problem of
smugglers who are determined to sneak
drugs into America but are too lazy to
buy a somewhat taller ladder and as we
all know all the security isn't just

name:Trevor Noah

text:about walls right and at one point Trump
started to talk about how dogs can also
help detect drugs on the border but much
like a dog himself Trump got distracted
we have equipment now that can spot
drugs it's incredible stuff

name:Trevor Noah

text:by the way there is nothing better than
a good old-fashioned German Shepherd
it's hard to believe you do love your
dogs don't you
I wouldn't mind having one honestly but
I don't have any time how would i look

name:Trevor Noah

text:walking a dog on the White House Lord
with that thing a lot of people say oh
you should get a dog why it's good
politically I said that that's not the
relationship I have with my food we want
to have yeah

name:Trevor Noah

text:Obama had a dog you're right yeah what
think I just scream Obama had a dog like
it's a bad thing
that's how much Trump has persuasion
over his people of these rallies he
managed to turn white people against

name:Trevor Noah

text:dogs dogs the thing why people love more
than anything when white people are
choosing a movie they will refuse to
watch anything where a dog dies they'll
be like Marley and me is too sad let's
watch Schindler's List let's do that I

name:Trevor Noah

text:don't wanna see a dog dying and by the
way I don't understand why Trump doesn't
like dogs
trunks should love dogs they pee all
over your bed and you don't even have to
pay them I know bad dog bad dog dog

name:Trevor Noah

text:could make that joke we'd make that joke
[Applause]
so last night's Trump rally was a trump
rally he's gonna build a wall the walls
were almost finished they build a wall a
lot of dogs the one you think we did

name:Trevor Noah

text:learn is that in addition to words the
president seems to struggle with numbers
too by the way we I we I'm one and one
I'm one for one think of it well we had
one election we won now we're gonna be
to furrow and everything's gonna be

name:Trevor Noah

text:yep yep yep that's right Trump is one
for one and if he wins again he's gonna
be to four oh that's not how math works
but at least now we know how Trump
successfully negotiated negative two
hundred million dollars for his wall

because 800,000 government workers are

shutdown in history 1995 we're coming
for you with no end in sight civil
servants are marching on Washington DC
and the president knows why people that
won't get next week's pay or the

name:Trevor Noah

text:following weeks pay I think if you ever
really looked at those people I think
they'd say mr. president
keep going he's talking about people who
work for the IRS or Homeland Security or
NASA and are about to miss their first

name:Trevor Noah

text:paycheck time to give these people a
chance to speak to the president
directly and to tell him to keep going
this is a card for President Trump to
tell him to keep going you write
whatever you want to President Trump and

name:Trevor Noah

of government employees hell no he wrote
keep going mr. president we are all not
behind you you mean not not is what he
meant to write yes stop the BS Bad Seeds
trying to come in from over the border

name:Trevor Noah

text:right we got it right see the people do
support the president you tell President
Trump exactly how much you support him
and what he's doing
just means a good simple change keep
going keep going keep going mr.

name:Trevor Noah

text:president keep going mr. president
where's everybody's leaving comeback
bundle cost everyone thanks so much
Michael now with all the support behind
him President Trump decided to plow
forward on proving his case for a border

name:Trevor Noah

text:wall so today
the commander-in-chief put on his travel
Bobby outfits and flew down to the
southern border to get a first-hand
account of the situation and while he
was there he gave us all a drunk history

name:Trevor Noah

text:lesson they say a wall has been evil
well so is the wheel a wheel is older
than a wall and I looked at every single
car out there even the really expensive
ones that the Secret Service uses and
believe me they are expensive I said do

name:Trevor Noah

text:they all have wheels yes oh I thought it
was variable the wheel is older than the
wall you know that and there are some
things that work you know what a wheel
works at a wall works you know if if a
football player got up after a tackle

name:Trevor Noah

text:and started talking like that the
trainer would be like we need to get you
to the locker room now your brain is not
okay and just by the way I don't even I
can't believe we have to say this if
there are any kids watching that are

name:Trevor Noah

text:gonna use this on a history test walls
are actually much older than the wheel
right 6,000 years older than the wheel
like back in the day cavemen had walls
so I guess people should stop calling
Trump in the end earth or because

name:Trevor Noah

text:Neanderthal would know that hashtag not
mine the NFL now after putting the
president's word through Google
Translate I think I think what he's
trying to say is that just because the
wall is old technology doesn't mean it's

name:Trevor Noah

text:not gonna be effective all right the
only problem is since walls have been
around for so long people have had
centuries to figure out how to get
through them the president and the oval
office address

name:Trevor Noah

text:Anna's administration have been pushing
this idea now of this a steel slat
barrier which is already in use down
here along the southern border we know
from DHS testing over the course of the
last year that all of president Trump's

name:Trevor Noah

text:prototypes were reachable in some way
but now for the first time NBC News has
exclusively obtained a photograph of the
steel slat barrier style border wall
design that was clearly cut through with
what we are told is a household saw okay

name:Trevor Noah

text:now you laugh but to be fair to be fair
you can't just get through with the
household saw okay you also need some
immigrants can do work ethic let me tell
you I've tried I've tried sewing before
and that takes forever after five

name:Trevor Noah

text:minutes I was like forget it I'm just
gonna bury the body in one piece like
actually it's so hard to sort through
that level of Steel that I think if a
Mexican manages to sawed his way into
America we should just give that person

name:Trevor Noah

text:a job yes yeah it's like just hire them
in fact here's my pitch is my pitch that
should be how you do merit-based
immigration right however they managed
to get in should just be like the skill
that you use to your advantage in

name:Trevor Noah

text:America if you saw through you work in
construction go straight away straight
away if they climb over the wall you're
a firefighter now go go
and then all you guys running away will
see you on the Olympic team

name:Trevor Noah

text:no no USA USA now now you now you'd
think you'd think you think the news
that you can just go through a steel
wall would be devastating news for Trump
but apparently he already knows about
this and he's not concerned this nothing

name:Trevor Noah

text:that can't be penetrated but you fix it
but it's a very difficult thing to do
but that's the wall and they have other
walls we have many walls under
consideration even concrete
this acid that can go through concrete

name:Trevor Noah

text:don't give them more ideas what are you
doing I didn't even know that it was
possible you're gonna build a wall and
tell everyone how to get through it
wouldn't be the worst bank robber ever
this is a stick-up but I've got a weak

name:Trevor Noah

text:wrist if you hit me right here the gun
will fly out it's just gonna fly out
right here but look I get what he's
saying again I get it even if a war
isn't 100% impenetrable it's still
better than nothing and America is gonna

name:Trevor Noah

text:need all the help it can get because the
way Trump tells us things on the border
are about to get nuts here's the story
there is another made you Caravan
forming right now in Honduras and so far
we're trying to break it up but so far

name:Trevor Noah

text:it's bigger than anything we've seen Wow
another Caravan it's so convenient how
whenever Trump needs to win something a
big scary Caravan is always coming to
kill us all because first it was the
midterms and now it's the shutdown like

name:Trevor Noah

text:I feel like if Trump isn't careful he's
gonna run into a boy who cried wolf
situation you know some day there is
gonna be a big Caravan full of Isis drug
dealers and Shrek's pouring over the
border and Trump will be like there

name:Trevor Noah

text:really is a caravan this time and we'll
be like whatever old men are the shrugs
eating my face basilic a caravan is
forming across the southern border and
making its way north I don't know why
but the president makes it sound like a

text:hurricane of Hondurans is heading for
the US you don't know I mean like say
what you want about him as president but
Donald Trump would make a great

there is another major caravan warming

and so far we're trying to break it up
but so far
it's bigger than anything we've seen and
a drone isn't going to stop it and the
sensor isn't going to swap it but you

name:Trevor Noah

text:know what's going to stop it in its
tracks a nice powerful wall
clearly Trump is not budging from his
insistence on a war which means this
shutdown will keep going on for who
knows how long and that's going to be

name:Trevor Noah

text:extremely hard on a lot of these workers
especially considering that many of
these government employees have to keep
working even if they're not getting paid
and I'm talking everyone all the way
from Secret Service to the TSA and say

name:Trevor Noah

text:what you want about the TSA but they
work hard to keep us safe
they don't get paid for a long time I'm
afraid that airports could start to look
a lot like this you know those are
personal

name:Trevor Noah

text:they smell too bad I mean who knows how
long this thing's gonna last Trump said
it could be years years yo that's crazy
man at least when I worked in McDonald's
we could like take free burgers home and
stuff here if I take somebody's luggage

name:Trevor Noah

text:and it's a problem yeah we just got to
face it Washington doesn't care about

text:bad enough for Trump the news that came
out this weekend has probably made him
feel even worse another shocking report
in The New York Times and the paper
claimed the FBI opened a
counterintelligence investigation into

name:Trevor Noah

text:whether the president was acting on
behalf of the Russians when he fired FBI
director James Comey last night on Fox
News the president asked point-blank
whether he worked on behalf of Russia
are you now or have you ever worked for

name:Trevor Noah

text:Russia mr. president I think it's the
most insulting thing I've ever been
asked how is that the most insulting
question he's ever been asked I mean
people have been asking him if he wants
to bang his daughter but that is more

name:Trevor Noah

text:insulting yeah the other question was
way more reasonable I mean we've all
seen her right we've all seen hers but
yes the New York Times reported that the
FBI investigates a dong Trump because
they thought he might be a secret

name:Trevor Noah

text:Russian spy which I'm sorry is just
crazy and not because he wouldn't do it
but because Donald Trump would be the
world's worst spy no one would hire him
right he can't be a spy he doesn't even
have an inside voice

name:Trevor Noah

text:he'll be out there like thank you for
meeting me under this bridge to exchange
these top-secret documents and also
spies are known for blending in if
there's one thing Trump doesn't do its
blend in red tie orange skin blond hair

name:Trevor Noah

text:the only place is blending isn't a job
starburst like he's not lived again so I
don't think Trump is a Russian spy
all right but I won't lie it doesn't
help his case when he's doing stuff like
this a bombshell report in The

name:Trevor Noah

text:Washington Post claiming President Trump
went to quote extraordinary lengths to
conceal details of his conversations
with Russian President Vladimir Putin
The Post reporting that at that private
meeting in Hamburg back in 2017 the

name:Trevor Noah

text:president confiscated his own
interpreters notes shutting out members
of the administration now you gotta
admit that's real shady right because
now everyone wants to know what did he
say to Putin that was so bad he couldn't

name:Trevor Noah

text:let anyone else see it could have been
collusion could have been something
worse you know like maybe Trump said I
love you and then Putin replied thank
you in which case I'm with Trump you can
never let that get out

name:Trevor Noah

text:but enough about Trump enough about
Trump let's talk about the people who
are gonna try and replace it because I
mean if you guys know this but it's only
659 days until the 2020 election so the
big question is which Democrat will take

name:Trevor Noah

text:on Trump well we're gonna be keeping you
up to date on every twist and turn of
the crowded Democratic race in our new
segment world war d
so as of right now there's about a
thousand Democrats who are expected to

name:Trevor Noah

text:run for president and I'll be honest
with you you know what I love about
American politics is that it's all a
game right most of the time the
politicians who stand a real chance of
winning they don't enter the race early

name:Trevor Noah

text:it's where's the fringe no names who
announced their candidacy first and you
know that reminds me up it reminds me of
a dance circle at a party all right
you ever go to like a company party or
anything where there's a dance circle

name:Trevor Noah

text:the first people who go in are always
the people who have no business dancing
in public they were like all the
confidence in the world like they get in
they got like all those moves and then
all the good dancers just stand on the

text:side and they'll be like popping and
locking and they'll be doing their thing
and you'd be like hey are you gonna
dance me like nod I don't know I don't
know I know I don't I don't really dance
anymore just yeah that's what always

so she's got an anti-gay past and she

name:Trevor Noah

text:out like for the last four years I've
been dating an ar-15
free hobby weisstein free hobby right
thing but the truth is this year is
special because we're not just hearing
from candidates who make you say who the

name:Trevor Noah

text:hell is that we're also hearing from
candidates who make you say remind me
who that is again former housing
secretary Julian Castro kicked off his
campaign for president in his hometown
of San Antonio Texas Castro was mayor of

name:Trevor Noah

text:San Antonio before he joined the Obama
administration this community is a
community like so many others across the
nation the American Dream is not a
sprint or even a marathon but a relay
together we will show that hope can be

name:Trevor Noah

text:bigger than beer that light can be
bigger than darkness and that truth can
be bigger than lies and as long as we
work for it tomorrow will always be
better than today so let's go work but
with us is it just me or does Castro

name:Trevor Noah

text:sound like he went to the Obama school
of speech like same cadence same
delivery maybe it is Obama like maybe he
just got fed up and he was like screw it
I'll run again
just give me my Hispanic mask and I'll

name:Trevor Noah

text:do it
you're like sure no one will fall for
that he's like that's what you said
about my birth certificate let's do it
come on
now now although although he is a

name:Trevor Noah

text:longshot Castro could be a real
contender he's a real contender he's
young but he also has Washington
experience he's a progressive person
who's running on universal pre-k and
affordable college his dad probably

name:Trevor Noah

text:wasn't Fidel Castro I mean these are all
the things you want in the candidates
but aside from Gabbard and Castro we've
also gotten an announcement from one of
the biggest names in politics Elizabeth
Warren and she celebrated her

name:Trevor Noah

text:announcement with a live Instagram chat
from inside her kitchen senator
Elizabeth Warren becoming the biggest
name in the Democratic field to signal
she's running for president now looking
to reintroduce herself to Democrats

name:Trevor Noah

text:connecting with supporters on Instagram
hold on a sec I'm gonna get me
[Applause]
I don't always drink beer but when I'm
trying to look relatable I do it on
Instagram how's an interesting choice

name:Trevor Noah

text:though right it really is an interesting
choice from Warren just drinking alone
in her kitchen I guess she wanted to
start her campaign the same way hillary
ended hers you know
[Music]

name:Trevor Noah

text:[Applause]
who made that joke all right I got my
steps in so as it stands in the past
months three Democratic candidates have
thrown their hats in the ring and that
means the 2020 race has officially begun

name:Trevor Noah

text:it's only January right you realize if
there are this many candidates now that
means by the summer this field will be
more crowded than chuck and Nancy at a
podium you understand that right and
ultimately the truth is the candidate

name:Trevor Noah

text:who manages to get through a primary
campaign this pact is gonna be the one
with the strongest and most passionate
base of supporters so what I'm saying is
don't be surprised if the Democrats 2020
nominee is the Instagram egg

you
today is day 19 of the government
shutdown the streets are piling up with
trash food is going uninspected and in
the capital they're being forced to use

name:Trevor Noah

text:both sides of the toilet paper the
Washington Monument is even walking the
streets just to make ends meet
and at 19 days we're only two days away
from this becoming the longest shutdown
in American history which I think Trump

name:Trevor Noah

text:is secretly going for he's like that's
right folks mine is the longest so today
at the White House the president met
with congressional leaders to try and
negotiate an end to the shutdown and
Trump shut that down too unfortunately

name:Trevor Noah

text:the president just got up and walked
down
he asked Speaker Pelosi will you agree
to my wall she said no and he just got
up and said then we have nothing to
discuss and he just walked down this was

name:Trevor Noah

text:what President Trump had to say about it
he said quote just left a meeting with
Chuck and Nancy a total waste of time I
asked are you going to improve border
security which includes a wall or steel
barrier Nancy said no I said bye-bye

name:Trevor Noah

text:nothing else works by bag don't man say
what you want about drunk some of the
things that he does a pretty badass
right because that's always been a dream
of mine I'm not gonna lie I've always
dreamed of walking into a meeting me

name:Trevor Noah

text:like are you guys gonna give me what I
want no well then this meetings over
bye-bye just like walk out I'm out
yeah oh sorry wait who validates parking
who you yeah because it's like two
dollars I don't N I don't break it I

name:Trevor Noah

text:yeah
now if you are disappointed about this
breakdown in talks then you must have
been really disappointed last night when
President Trump went on television for
his very first oval office address in

name:Trevor Noah

text:primetime all day everyone was
speculating was he gonna declare a state
of emergency was he gonna reopen the
government was he pregnant and Mexico
was the father
but when nine o'clock rolled around all

name:Trevor Noah

text:we got from Trump was basically another
immigration stump speech and like not
even one of these fun ones you know we
like jokes often imaginary Giants or
whatever he's doing
instead we just we just got a low-energy

name:Trevor Noah

text:Jeb version of Trump my fellow Americans
tonight I am speaking to you because
there is a growing humanitarian and
security crisis at our southern border
all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled
illegal migration the federal government

name:Trevor Noah

text:remains shut down for one reason and one
reason only because Democrats will not
fund border security this is a
humanitarian crisis a crisis of the
heart and a crisis of the soul so crisis
of this whole you know Trump had to

name:Trevor Noah

text:practice that word hard because he's
never said it before I
he was probably reading a draft of the
speech like a crisis of the soul soul
soul did you guys just make up this word
I love it give me more nonsense words

name:Trevor Noah

text:like this I love it so so and look for
all the hype the speech wasn't even that
long it was only ten minutes and eight
minutes of it was just Trump sniffing
this barrier is absolutely critical to
border security that defends our borders

name:Trevor Noah

text:and reopens the government Democrats in
Congress have refused to acknowledge the
crisis you're slipping so much it sounds
like he's trying to get all the drugs
off the street himself I'll get rid of
them

name:Trevor Noah

text:bring them to me but even in that short
10 minutes president Trump managed to
pack in a lot of scaring the shit out of
people about illegal immigrants our
southern border is a pipeline for vast
quantities of illegal drugs meth heroin

name:Trevor Noah

text:cocaine more Americans will die from
drugs this year
sex crimes violent killings murdered
raped beaten beheading dismembering
blood blood
good lord so much violence this thing

name:Trevor Noah

text:was on TV at 9:00 p.m. this isn't belong
on network this is an HBO speech they
should have put up one of those content
warnings first so you could get the kids
out of the room you know and now should
be fair to be fair some of you can read

name:Trevor Noah

text:I like that now to be fair Trump isn't
making up these crimes right let's be
honest the sad truth is some illegal
immigrants have done very bad things but
if you only listen to Trump you get the
impression that everyone is crossing the

name:Trevor Noah

text:border just to come and murder Americans
and we know that that's not true right
you could you could just as easily pick
stories to make immigrants look flawless
I can show you a headline about an
illegal immigrant who saved someone's

name:Trevor Noah

text:life true story
I can show you another story of an
undocumented business owner who went on
to create jobs for Americans true story
or an illegal immigrant who even went on
to become the first lady of the United

name:Trevor Noah

text:States I'm sorry I misspoke I meant an
immigrant who maybe didn't have the
right papers at the time she was working
in this country at the time but as a
nation America said we can't let those
cheekbones get away we need those

name:Trevor Noah

text:cheekbones so America can be best and
she stayed and Democrats knew Democrats
knew that Trump would spend his whole
speech fear-mongering which is why they
demanded equal time after his speech to
give their counter arguments and right

name:Trevor Noah

text:away in classic Democrat style it was
well-intentioned but real awkward good
evening I appreciate the opportunity to
speak directly to you mitt okay okay I'm
sorry I'm sorry what the hell is this
guy

name:Trevor Noah

text:why are you sharing one podium that
damaged you guys really are socialists
what are you doing
so why you look so grouchy what is this
it looks like the hostess at IHOP just
told them there's no senior discount and

name:Trevor Noah

text:look I'll be honest with you I'm not
gonna waste your time you don't even
really need to listen to the Democratic
response because for them it was also
the same things that they've been saying
the whole time immigrants are good Wars

name:Trevor Noah

text:are bad emojis are problematic it was
all the same stuff so the truth is we
didn't learn anything yesterday except
that America needs funding for a second
podium and Breathe Right strips that's
what we do know that's what we do know

name:Trevor Noah

text:and right now it looks like the shutdown
could go on for a very long time because
both sides feel like they have a mandate
from voters all right
Trump could say that he won the
presidency promising a border wall so he

name:Trevor Noah

text:has a duty to build that wall but on the
other hand he also promised that Mexico
would pay for it the Democrats could say
that they just won the midterms in a
landslide and they ran against the wall
so they have an obligation to stop it

name:Trevor Noah

text:but the one thing everyone should be
able to agree on is that none of this
should shut the government down this is
politics this is what you're supposed to
be discussing it's your job and it's
also disingenuous for president Trump to

name:Trevor Noah

text:try and blame the shutdown on the
Democrats especially after saying this I
am proud to shut down the government for
border security I will be the one to
shut it down I'm not gonna blame you for
it unless it goes bad then I'm blaming

name:Trevor Noah

text:you guys bye-bye
and and the frustrating thing is that
illegal immigration is a nuanced complex
issue something I feel like we've we've
completely lost now as people right it
involves asylum seekers and involves

name:Trevor Noah

text:visa overstays daca kids the dreamers so
much more it's not an easy issue but
because of Trump no one is talking about
that anymore the whole debate has just
devolved into wall or no wall like
caveman Congress and if there's one

name:Trevor Noah

text:thing we know it's that nothing will
stop immigrants from trying to come to
America it's a place that people dream
of coming to because people who are
trying to make a better safer life for
their families will do anything to

name:Trevor Noah

text:achieve that dream and I know Donald
Trump understands this because of this
video we found from 15 years ago
never ever give up don't give up don't
allow it to happen if there's a concrete
wall in front of you go through it go

name:Trevor Noah

there is a possible fatal I would come
there some possible fatal consequences
and that that gets you a little worried

name:Trevor Noah

well actually I've read the fine print

these dumb ideas the same place that

doesn't matter where you go I went to a

name:Trevor Noah

have a choir
they had a deejay those the dopest thing
I was like do unto others of those
others Jesus died for your sins well
pray until 6:00 in the morning I'm glad

name:Trevor Noah

text:we praise I don't know if it's just me
but I I feel like I feel like everybody
out here is excited about the midterms
you guys excited yeah you feel that
energy you know you know who else is
really excited Donald Trump oh wow wow

name:Trevor Noah

text:you guys sound like a room full of
milania's Wow well anyway just just like
you President Trump knows that the
midterms only seven days away and so she
motivates his voters right he's doing
something really special well it's the

name:Trevor Noah

text:thing that he does best he's scaring the
shit out of his voters all right
specifically by using brown people it's
sort of like Halloween but a racist
Halloween you know or as megyn kelly
calls it Halloween and and so every day

name:Trevor Noah

text:Trump's number one focus has been the
caravan all right I don't if you've seen
this and if you don't know the caravan
is basically a group of a few thousand
people who are walking to the United
States from impoverished and

name:Trevor Noah

text:crime-ridden countries like Honduras and
Guatemala and they're walking to the US
partly as a protest and partly to apply
for asylum and a better life and then
it's it's a soft journey they've got no
food they've got no water there's no way

name:Trevor Noah

text:to bathe it's basically like Burning Man
except the people aren't pretending to
be poor you know what I'm saying like
it's it's a group of people who are
saying to America hey we're in trouble
can you help us and Trump has responded

name:Trevor Noah

text:with this the US military said today
it's sending more than 5,000 active-duty
troops to the Mexican border to deal
with a caravan of Central Americans who
intend to seek asylum here
those 5200 troops actually outnumbering

name:Trevor Noah

text:the roughly 4,000 migrants making up
that Caravan and nearly equaling the
number of US personnel fighting Isis in
Iraq really trump is sending the same
amount of troops to deal with asylum
seekers as he sent to fight Isis like

name:Trevor Noah

text:that is gonna be so weird for the troops
me like one guy talking to another's
like I'm headed to Iraq to stop a
violent death cult from destroying
civilization where are you going
it's like oh I'm going to try come it's

name:Trevor Noah

text:a baby to crawl south yeah
just switch around hey you know what's
even worse is that Trump is sending more
troops than they are migrants right so
the troops can basically play man on man
defense you know just like okay you get

name:Trevor Noah

text:one I'll get Jose I'll take the old lady
come on come on abuela come on abuela
come on come on
ah she got to my legs god damn it abuela
and you descend more
and now and now just just around the

name:Trevor Noah

text:same page
these people aren't illegal anything
right they're planning to apply for
asylum once they get to the US border
right it's not like they're just gonna
rush across the border like a giant game

name:Trevor Noah

text:of Red Rover that's not what's gonna
happen oh that would be super dope can
we admit that that would be super dope
yeah like in fact instead of having a
border wall America just have the troops
holding hands at the border right and

name:Trevor Noah

text:then the immigrants run and if they
break through you get citizenship I
think that's a fair game I'm watching
that show I don't know about you but I'm
watching that show this summer on NBC
it's Red Rover citizenship edition

name:Trevor Noah

text:sending 5,000 troops to the border why
not send 5,000 judges and lawyers to
help with the asylum process what's in
the troops anything would make more
sense than sending 5,000 troops I like
you would even make more sense if Trump

name:Trevor Noah

text:was just like you know what America's
just gonna turn off the lights and
pretend no one is home that would even
make more sense just like everyone be
quiet although you know Trump would mess
that up everyone to be quiet and they'd

name:Trevor Noah

text:be like we're not here my parents told
me to say we're not here and now I think
the reason Donald Trump is sending
troops so these asylum seekers instead
of help is because in his mind this is
an invasion and when I say in his mind

name:Trevor Noah

text:what I mean is on Fox News thousands
upon thousands of migrants literally
marching to the US and what would be a
mass invasion in order to demand entry
this migrant caravan it's not a caravan
it's an invasion here is a mob of

name:Trevor Noah

text:humanity driving towards the u.s.
southern border this looks a lot like an
invasion it's an actual invasion and
invasion thousands and thousands of
people in the bridge when you looked at
that bridge loaded up with people that's

name:Trevor Noah

text:called an invasion of our
three really an invasion get the fuck
out of here man invasion let me ask you
this let me ask you this can I ask you
this what kind of invaders apply to come
in and give the enemy three months

name:Trevor Noah

text:warning yeah what kind of invasion is
that like I missed the history class
where Paul Revere was like the British
are coming but not until like April okay
King George's wanted me to tell you guys
in advance because he knows you guys are

name:Trevor Noah

text:like super busy okay hey here's my
problem here's my problem with all the
fear-mongering my big front with the
fear-mongering about this Caravan is
that Trump Annie's friends they don't
even seem to know what they're afraid of

name:Trevor Noah

text:and their company with diseases such as
smallpox and leprosy and TB that are
gonna affect our people in the United
States the overwhelming majority are
young men in their 20s des strapping
they're strong we got HIV measles

name:Trevor Noah

text:produces rubella rabies hepatitis A
influenza TB shigellosis syphilis when
you look at that Caravan and you look
largely very you know big percentage of
men young strong a lot of bad people
that's right these migrants are both

name:Trevor Noah

text:super-strong and riddled with disease
these are the strongest lepers I've ever
seen he's coming across the border the
jack bombs falling off in the streets
make up your mind and honestly honestly
if I were the migrants I would be

name:Trevor Noah

text:worried about catching one of America's
weird diseases seen the shit people have
in this country cause the Micra not be
like a man I want a better life but I
don't know about America I don't wanna
catch a gluten intolerance man you hear

name:Trevor Noah

text:they have irritable bowel syndrome up
there man I had a cousin who went there
two months later he had restless leg
syndrome you can't kill that shit and
now
and I know I know some of you right now

name:Trevor Noah

text:are asking me you're going Trevor why do
you even bother with Fox News you know
who they are they're always bringing
their brings in a phobia that they're
bringing racism and that's true that is
true but here's the thing I assume that

name:Trevor Noah

text:some of them are good people because
even though this network might seem like
one giant caravan of dangerous
extremists I believe there are people in
there who mean well the migrants
according to fox news reporting are more

name:Trevor Noah

text:than two months away if any of them
actually come here but tomorrow is one
week before the midterm election which
is what all of this is about there is no
invasion no one's coming to get you
there's nothing at all the way about

name:Trevor Noah

text:know that you can handle it now that's a
guy who deserves asylum

is it right for people to protest

cable news pundits they have the answer

name:Trevor Noah

text:we need to stop all this and begin to
behave in a civilized manner if we can't
agree to disagree and let each other be
and neither side wants to do that it
becomes a problem there are certain
lines I think that even in this

politics it but people realize you
shouldn't cross are you allowed to just
kick someone out because you don't agree

whatever happened to tolerance yes

got grabbed by the pussy didn't you hear
you didn't hear

happened to tolerance like these people

it's like if I had beef with the

text:argument when people say but Trevor why
can't we be polite why not fight hate
with love just like Gandhi and Nelson
Mandela don't don't ever forget in their
time people were not exactly happy with
how they protested right the British

name:Trevor Noah

text:called Gandhi an agitator governments
around the world called Nelson Mandela a
terrorist and every day we see people on
the news and social media saying why
can't these protesters be more like
Martin Luther King he was civil that's

name:Trevor Noah

text:why he named it the civil rights but
what you forget is back when Martin was
marching people were complaining about
him the same way these people are
complaining about protesters right now
we build you're sick and tired of Martin

name:Trevor Noah

text:Luther King
there is ban he's attempted to stir up
strife disorder and violence
best thing for King to do is to get out

he's a menace to the peace of this city

of troublemakers who jump about the
south like so many fleas on a hot

none have heretofore existed Wow races
back then were so eloquent but Porter

and I like that he says Martin Luther
King created racial tension where none
existed like dr. King went into the
South and was like y'all are black no I
know that those leaders may have been

name:Trevor Noah

text:racist but even some people who said
they agreed with what dr. King stood for
still didn't approve of how he did it in
fact at one point he had a 63%
disapproval rating in the u.s. so look
all I'm saying is what happened to Sarah

name:Trevor Noah

text:Huckabee Sanders isn't nice but as a
government official people protesting
your policies is part of the job and the

[Music]
[Music]
With the shutdown stuck in a
stalemate,
the phrase that everyone
has been talking about
is "national emergency."

name:Trevor Noah

text:The president has warned
he might declare
a national emergency,
going around Congress
to get his border wall built.
President Trump is prepared
to do what's necessary.
We have a national crisis.
We can call
a national emergency,

name:Trevor Noah

text:because of the security
of our country.
Absolutely.
No, we can do it.
I haven't done it.
I may do it.
I may do it.
Isn't it comforting
to have a president
who always sounds
like a guy on a ledge?

name:Trevor Noah

text:"I'll do it, man.
Don't come any closer.
"I'll do it. I'll do it.
All I wanted was a wall, man.
Nobody listened, man.
I'll do it."
But that's right. Trump has
claimed that as president,
he can declare
illegal immigration
as a national emergency,

name:Trevor Noah

text:and then, he wouldn't need
congressional approval
to build the wall. He can just
do it himself, right?
Well, not himself, himself.
I mean, he's never done
manual labor in his life.
I mean, like,
I bet if he tried
to build the wall,
that would be a disaster.

name:Trevor Noah

text:He'd be like,
"And what's this, again?"
They'd be like,
"That's a brick, Mr. President."
Be like, "Do I eat it?"
"Uh, Mr. President,
didn't you work in construction
your whole life?"
He'd be like, "I only talk
to the guys with the weird hats,

name:Trevor Noah

text:and they made the buildings
go high, high."
(laughter)
Like, Trump doesn't
do anything for himself.
He doesn't, though!
He's probably never even
jacked himself off. Like...
-(laughter, groaning) -Yeah.
He just calls in the butler.

name:Trevor Noah

text:He's like, "Shall we begin
with the lotion, sir?"
"No, Jeeves.
I think we'll go dry today."
"Very good, sir.
Shall I fantasize
for you, as well, sir?"
"Yes, Jeeves. Let's go
with two girls kissing."
"Very hot, sir. Very hot."

name:Trevor Noah

text:And look, it's not like
other presidents
haven't declared national
emergencies before, all right?
They've done it for lots
of things.
Uh, for instance,
President Carter
declared a national emergency
during
the Iranian hostage crisis

name:Trevor Noah

text:in order to put sanctions
on Iran, right.
President Obama declared
an emergency during swine flu
to help hospitals respond
more effectively.
And President Bush declared
an emergency
when Friends went off the air.
He was like,
"America needs to know

name:Trevor Noah

text:if Joey finds love.
Hee-hee-hee-hee."
"Sir, they're making
a Joey spinoff."
"Oh, thank God.
Emergency over."
So, presidents declare national
emergencies all the time.
What they don't do
is declare an emergency
just to win a policy fight
with Congress.

name:Trevor Noah

text:So, the question
we need to answer is,
is Trump even allowed
to do this?
Can President Trump declare
a national emergency
to build the border wall
with Mexico?
In a word, yes.
What is actually considered
a national emergency?

name:Trevor Noah

text:That's where the legal language
gets stickier.
In 1934, the U.S. Supreme Court
said basically,
the situation should be urgent
and infrequent,
really big-- like on the scale
of a natural disaster--
and not reasonably expected
or anticipated.
Yeah, so for something to be
considered a national emergency,

name:Trevor Noah

text:the Supreme Court ruled
a situation must be urgent,
infrequent and unexpected.
Basically, America should have
a urinary tract infection.
(laughter, groaning)
And if you think about it,
none of these things apply
to illegal immigration,

name:Trevor Noah

text:which has been more of like
a steady, constant drip, okay?
Still needs to be checked out,
but it's not an emergency.
The problem is,
the Supreme Court doesn't get
to weigh in immediately, right.
Trump can declare
a national emergency,
and then, the moment he does,

name:Trevor Noah

text:there are all sorts of things
that he can do.
Many of these powers are really
quite narrow, quite reasonable,
but some of them seem like the
stuff of authoritarian regime.
So there are powers
that would allow the president
to shut down
communications facilities
and to freeze
Americans' bank accounts, or

name:Trevor Noah

text:to deploy
the military domestically.
Okay, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's one thing
to freeze our bank accounts,
or send troops to our houses,
but shutting down
communications?
That means Trump could turn off
the Internet, like Instagram?

name:Trevor Noah

text:(laughter)
How am I supposed
to get sponsorships now? Huh?
You think I'm just
gonna walk down the street
yelling at people
about my juice cleanse? Huh?
Just gonna be like, "Hey, hey,
you want to poop like me?!
Drink this!"

name:Trevor Noah

text:I'd sound like a crazy person.
Come on, Trump.
(applause and cheering)
These are serious powers,
people!
And when you listen to it,
it sounds really undemocratic,
'cause when you think
about America, right,

name:Trevor Noah

text:you don't think
of an autocratic ruler.
You think of pickup trucks and
restaurants named after boobs.
Freedom, baby. Yeah.
But if Congress...
but if Congress was going
to give a president
these powers,
you would think
that they would be very specific

name:Trevor Noah

text:about how the president
could use them.
And if you thought that,
you would be thinking wrong.
Congress chose consciously
 not to include a definition
of "national emergency."
The idea behind emergency powers
is pretty simple.
It's the idea that the laws
that ordinarily apply

name:Trevor Noah

text:just might not be sufficient
in the case of an emergency,
and if you have a true crisis
that's unfolding so quickly
that Congress, uh, doesn't
have time to react to it,
then you might need
to have some standby authorities
that give the president
more flexibility.
Ah, that actually makes sense.

name:Trevor Noah

text:Congress can't say what every
emergency situation might be
in the future,
so they leave it vague,
because what counts
as an emergency is different
for different people, right?
For some people, an emergency is
black people barbecuing, right?
For other people,
waiting for those three dots

name:Trevor Noah

text:in a text message is
an emergency.
"Are you up or not?!"
(laughter)
So, Congress left it open
to interpretation
because they assumed
the president would be somebody
responsible

name:Trevor Noah

text:and trustworthy
and potty-trained.
(laughter)
They didn't think
there'd be a President Trump,
which is why they left
such a big loophole.
Which goes back
to what we've been saying
about Trump
for a very long time.

name:Trevor Noah

text:He's basically the black light
on American democracy, right?
You realize there were
all these flaws in America
that nobody ever noticed
before he showed up,
and then, all of a sudden,
it was, like, "Oh, bam!
"Oh, wow! What is that?
"Oh, the president...

name:Trevor Noah

text:"The president doesn't have
to show his tax returns.
"Oh, and the president
doesn't have
"to divest from his businesses.
"And-and, holy shit, he...
"he might be able
to pardon himself.
"That's crazy! And...
oh, and what is that down there?

name:Trevor Noah

text:"What is... what is that?
Oh, that's...
"Oh, that's just a mustard stain
"from when Thomas...
Thomas Jefferson signed the...
"Oh, yeah, he just signed
the most important document
"with his lunch.
Okay, that was weird.
That's not Trump's fault."

name:Trevor Noah

text:So now, thanks to Trump,
thanks to Trump,
we've learned that,
during a national emergency,
a president can do way more
than just build a wall, right?
He can shut down your Internet,
send the troops in.
He can just control the country.
So if I'm the Democrats,
I would give Trump the wall

name:Trevor Noah

text:before he finds out
what he can really do.
I know it sounds crazy,
but think about it.
Right now, he's like the baby
from The Incredibles, right?
He only knows that he can float.
We do not want him finding out
that he can shoot lasers
out of his eyes.

name:Trevor Noah

text:that whole rally was hilarious I don't
if you watch the Trump was in El Paso
fighting for the wall and like he just I
mean like one thing about him is he's
terrifying but he's hilarious at the
same time right and he goes on this rant

name:Trevor Noah

text:about like all the technology that
America has and how like sometimes old
things are better than new things that's
why walls work greats instead of other
technology then he starts talking about
how they showed him new technologies

name:Trevor Noah

text:that can find bombs in airports but then
dogs are still better than the
technology and then he's like I love
dogs and he said you guys love dogs I
don't like dogs
do you guys have dog I don't have a dog

name:Trevor Noah

text:I don't have a dad can you imagine me
with a dog and this is when like he just
goes off like his mind he just goes he's
like a dog that just saw squirrel just
like he's like I don't have a death can
you imagine me with the dog folks can't

name:Trevor Noah

text:imagine me with a dog no dog some people
say I should get a dog I don't want a
dog I can't I can't can you imagine me
on the White House lawn walking a dog
folks walking it that's not me folks
that's not me I could never do and I was

name:Trevor Noah

text:just like it's so funny but if you if
you are an immigrant especially an
African immigrant Trump reminds you of
every African father you've ever come
across in your life because that's like
the exact same reasoning that they have

name:Trevor Noah

text:like that just be like like a little kid
be like that he can have a dog it'd be
like a dog
you want me to own a dog ah and then
what is a man am i working that can you
imagine me walking a dog ah now this

name:Trevor Noah

text:animal is pulling me I'm a grown man but
the animal is put in here oh the dog
wants to go poopoo all right now I might
take the dog to book them when you poop
who must pick it up huh now I'm picking
up them now can you imagine telling

name:Trevor Noah

text:people your father is picking up poop or
eyes that what you're going to tell them
is that what you know I don't know dog
for me there's no dogs here no there's
no dogs for me no no no no dogs
get out of that this is living his best

name:Trevor Noah

text:life I don't
a dog folks I can't see it can't see it
not me no and they're like one of the
guys in the crowd screams like Obama had
a dog he's like yeah oh my Madden in the
car like it's like wait so now why

name:Trevor Noah

text:people are booing dogs it's just that
was the craziest thing what what he's
saying it's not what they were trying to
say in that moment and he has too much
time on his hands that's right okay that
this is the from the same guy who just

name:Trevor Noah

text:built a full golf simulator in the White
House that's what literally today the
news came out Trump just built a brand
new golf simulator like a full
state-of-the-art golf simulator in the
White House yes cuz Obama

name:Trevor Noah

text:yeah it's inside what's funny is that
actually Obama had a golf simulator as
well and then Trump bought and bought a
new one like a super state-of-the-art
one like the latest model and we were
like like why would he do that and I'm

on the dance floor everyone's having a
good time and then Beyonce starts
walking in my direction
so I'm like oh I should move right

name:Trevor Noah

text:because it's Beyonce where she is going
is not to me so I mean like I'm like I
must move it's Beyonce and I also do not

making Beyonce do this weird movie and

name:Trevor Noah

text:I'm like ah sorry Beyonce I'm so sorry
it was yeah it was if it never happens
again it's fine I'm done
[Music]
you
I'm Tommy Central's World News

name:Trevor Noah

text:headquarters in needles
[Music]
we're learning things about what
President Trump does before bed at night
and it's even worse than you think this
week's New York magazine reports the

name:Trevor Noah

text:Trump and the Fox News host Sean Hannity
speak on the phone most weeknights the
report also quotes a former White House
official who says Hannity and Fox create
a feedback loop that puts Trump in a
quote weird head space adding quote what

name:Trevor Noah

text:ends up happening is judge Jeanine Pirro
or Hannity fill them up with a bunch of
crazy expletive and everyone on staff
has to go and knock down all the
expletive fires they started okay okay
you have to admit it's cute that these

name:Trevor Noah

text:two talk before bed every night yeah
they're like eight year old treehouse
buddies with those cans and strings you
know gossiping about which girls they
secretly paid off you know or whether
it's Yanni or Laurel it's Laurel by the

name:Trevor Noah

text:way but that feedback loop part is
really weird for me right there saying
that present Trump says something
outlandish to Hannity on the phone handy
then repeats it on TV and then Trump
watches that and goes you see exactly

name:Trevor Noah

text:that's what I was saying Trump is like
that gorilla getting riled up but what
he's doing in the mirror he's like you
see what he did and here's my favorite
part of this story
White House staff know that the calls

name:Trevor Noah

text:happen thanks to the president entering
a room and announcing I just hung up
with Hannity or even ringing Hannity up
from his desk in their presence how are
you both the president and the stock how
like no other world leader does that you

name:Trevor Noah

text:realize that Putin's never talking to
his assistant like not the big deal but
I was at party with actor who plays
Sheldon on Big Bang yeah
Elon Musk and grunge there too just
saying yeah yeah so lawmakers in both

name:Trevor Noah

text:parties are against Trump separating
kids from their parents and more
surprising even Trump is against Trump
separating kids from their parents we
want to solve this problem we want to
solve family separation I don't want

name:Trevor Noah

text:children take it away from parents now I
know you might be a little confused
right now like why would Trump hate the
policy that he himself made but let's be
real you don't always love everything
you make the president the president

name:Trevor Noah

text:can't just changed this policy I mean
well he can but not without the approval
of his most trusted advisors and the
problem is the members of trumps TV
cabinet seem like they seem to be fine
with everything that's happening for

name:Trevor Noah

text:instance here's the secretary of
inhumane services Laura Ingraham since
more illegal immigrants are rushing the
border more kids are being separated
from their parents and temporarily
housed and what are essentially summer

name:Trevor Noah

text:camp camps or is the San Diego
union-tribune described them today is
looking like basically boarding schools
[Music]
know what what kind of freaky ass summer
camps does she go to was a family just

name:Trevor Noah

text:dropping off every June at state prison
she was coming up like camp was so fun
we made license plates and and Sam's and
I I got this teardrop tattoo you only
get that if you kill people yeah but
just to be clear once again the point is

name:Trevor Noah

text:not how nice the places are that they're
keeping these kids in right the point is
that the federal government is snatching
kids away from their parents if you
kidnap someone's kid but you keep them
in a really nice basement that's still

name:Trevor Noah

text:not okay Liam Neeson wasn't like what
kind of food are you feeding her what
sushi well I guess she has been taken
care of
[Applause]
so laura ingalls Ingram's so laura

name:Trevor Noah

text:ingraham clearly won't be advising the
President to stop separating these
families and neither will director of
false equivalencies Tucker Carlson this
is one of those moments that tells you
everything about our ruling class they

name:Trevor Noah

text:care far more about foreigners than
about their own people they don't care
because no matter what they tell you
this is not about helping children a lot
of people are yelling at you on TV don't
even have children so don't for a second

name:Trevor Noah

text:let them take the moral high ground wow
this Angry McNugget seriously just said
you can't care about kids unless you
have kids that is the dumbest logic I
have ever heard
how does Tucker not get that you can

name:Trevor Noah

text:care about things that don't directly
affect you but I'm just glad that he's a
TV pundit and not a doctor like dr.
Carson what what should I do about my
cancer well I don't have cancer so
really I don't give a yeah I I just

name:Trevor Noah

text:don't but uh
but if you ever get hemorrhoids give me
a call yeah so top advisors Tucker and
Laura clearly won't let the president
change this policy that he hates so much
and it's gonna get even worse if he

name:Trevor Noah

text:watches Fox and Friends
because Brian Kilmeade was making every
single arguments in one sentence at the
same time as Nancy Pelosi steps over the
homeless in San Francisco to hop on a
plane to go to the border to have a

name:Trevor Noah

text:heart bleed for them for people from
other countries that are coming here
understand we are twenty trillion
dollars in debt we have classrooms that
overrun we have teachers buying their
own supplies these kids come in

name:Trevor Noah

text:fantastic Oprah Winfrey I'm glad you're
upset about it but what these kids get
banned out to working-class
neighborhoods into our society and then
they have to be paid for by English as a
Second Language and then they got to be

name:Trevor Noah

text:schooled and a lot of them said Lee
right when in my neighborhood turn into
ms-13 was that
I'm sorry that that's not an argument
that was just like conservative slam
poetry she's like hello see Oprah

name:Trevor Noah

text:Winfrey killing the American dream with
ms-13 team team team team
look man the fact of the matter is
separating kids from their parents is
heartless okay and the only way that we
can stop the government from doing it is

name:Trevor Noah

text:to demand change so get on the phone and
call the people who can actually do
something about this and I'm not talking
about Congress I'm talking about the
policymakers at Fox News yeah call them
because they can do something so that

name:Trevor Noah

text:was a very bad day for president Trump
not only was his favorite comedian found
guilty but then the man he picked for
Veterans Affairs was forced to withdraw
from consideration and on top of all of
that

name:Trevor Noah

text:Trump's 23andme results came back and
they confirmed that he's 50% Eric
so some did what everyone does when
they're feeling down he called into a
Fox News Morning Show and it was
honestly epic because normally when

name:Trevor Noah

text:Trump has a bad day we know Trump
watches Fox and Friends and yells at the
TV but today he did the same thing but
we all got to listen in and you could
tell from the start that this was going
to be special thank you so much for

name:Trevor Noah

text:being with us mr. president well good
morning and I picked a very very special
day because it's milania's birthday so I
said let's do it or in milania's
birthday so happy birthday - milania's
all right hopefully they'll be visits in

name:Trevor Noah

text:between but have you decided on or do
you want to tell us what you got her
well I better not get into that because
I may get in trouble maybe I didn't get
her so much I'd say what she has done I
got her a beautiful card

name:Trevor Noah

text:how did Trump mess up the world's
easiest question it's like they threw
him a softball and he swung and hit
himself in the dick
[Applause]
and I mean it's her birthday I can't

name:Trevor Noah

text:believe that Donald didn't get Melania
anything for her birthday now she might
think he's not a very good husband also
I would pay anything to know what he
wrote inside that card that he
definitely didn't actually get like

name:Trevor Noah

text:roses are red love is a mystery
I had a historic electoral college
victory while it Trump's say he called
into Fox & Friends
because it was milania's birthday like
what does that mean it's like honey I've

name:Trevor Noah

text:got a great celebration planned for us
today I'm gonna talk to some TV people
while sitting on the toilet
Oh Thank You Donald my life is a
beautiful dream okay so so the interview
didn't get off to a great start but then

name:Trevor Noah

text:it got worse I get along with Connie I
get along with a lot of people frankly
but Kanye looks and he sees black
unemployment at the lowest it's been in
the history of our country Republicans
done a bad job ignoring the black

name:Trevor Noah

text:community up until now you know I think
it was just a custom people don't
realize you know if you go back to the
Civil War was the Republicans that
really did the thing Lincoln was a
Republican Republicans did the thing

name:Trevor Noah

text:Trump would make a dope history teacher
it would be so easy to pause class what
was the turning point in the civil law
the thing a plus like he's the first
sober person I've heard doing drunk
history that's amazing

name:Trevor Noah

text:now this interview was so long and
incoherent and rambling that even
Trump's friends on Fox and Friends
became uncomfortable and you could tell
by the looks on their faces and I will
not be involved with the Justice

name:Trevor Noah

text:Department I will wait till this is over
it's a total it's all lies it's a
disgrace and and by the way no no but
think of it but their loss of the
electoral college that they should never
lose because the electoral college is

name:Trevor Noah

text:set up seven hundred thousand years to
approve of years we have judges there
who would think that these guys would
treat me great I made them a fortune so
they keep me horribly but and there's
people say you're still looking good mr.

name:Trevor Noah

text:president my chest about just there is
no collusion with me I would rather have
the popular vote because it's to me it's
much easier to totally different set of
goals as the electoral college we have
an electoral college right I got 306 and

name:Trevor Noah

text:she got what 223 so remember there was
no way to break 270 I heard that on CBS
and NBC and ABC they're all fake news I
said that for so long and then what
about do better than people think of
them mr. president right we could talk

name:Trevor Noah

text:to you all day but it looks like you
have a million things to do
[Applause]
I can safely say that I've never seen a
news anchor try to bail on an interview
with the President of the United States

name:Trevor Noah

text:like how is it that he's the commander
in chief but it's the couch people who
have better things to do we'd love to
keep chatting but there's a video of a
dog skateboarding that we have to get to
mr. president goodbye like I never

name:Trevor Noah

text:thought I'd say this but I actually
almost feel bad for Fox and Friends
because if you're at a party and some
boring ass dude wouldn't stop talking to
you could just be like oh I had to go
get a drink but these poor guys are on

name:Trevor Noah

text:live television the only excuse they
could come up with was that Trump
probably had important things to do when
it was pretty clear that he absolutely
did not like no I actually have the
whole day free after all it's milania's

name:Trevor Noah

text:birthday he came out last week that
Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen
who is now in deep federal investigation
 only had three clients in the past
year
all right the president who Cohen helped

name:Trevor Noah

text:to pay off a porn star that he had an
affair with his second client a major
GOP fundraiser named Elliot Brody who
Cohen also helped to pay off for
playmates that he had an affair with
right and then Michael Ploen Cohen had

name:Trevor Noah

text:one more client right out of seven
billion people
seven billion people who could have
wanted to join this club and use Michael
Cohen as a lawyer last year only one
other person did and this person's

name:Trevor Noah

text:identity was a complete mystery until
today we are now getting word the lawyer
for the president Michael Cohen has just
disclosed in court that the client who
had requested to remain unnamed was sean
hannity of fox news

name:Trevor Noah

text:thank you
yeah it turns out Michael Cohen's secret
clients were Sean Hannity which I'm
sorry it's not a good look you know
right now Sean Hannity's probably on the
phone with his wife like hey honey it's

name:Trevor Noah

text:so weird how I use the guy who pays off
mistresses to get me out of that parking
ticket it's funny right hello hello
hello just think about how how unethical
this is for a moments right Hannity has
been reporting on this Michael Kohn

name:Trevor Noah

text:story from the beginning from the
beginning but he conveniently never
mentioned that Cowan was his guy and
I'll tell you what else let's see what
else once you know that Hannity has
personal skill and skin in the game like

name:Trevor Noah

text:with Cowan it's fun to go back and look
at everything he said about the FBI ray
because now we can see that Hannity
wasn't just mad he was scared
president Trump's longtime personal
attorney Michael Kohn just had his

name:Trevor Noah

text:office his home and his hotel that he
was staying in raided by the FBI today
this is an unprecedented abuse of power
Kohl's payment is a perfectly legitimate
business move motors which fund
investigation is now a runaway train

name:Trevor Noah

text:careening off the trash spinning out of
control if you voted for Donald Trump
you better get buckled up because this
is gonna be a rough ride you don't now
that we know he was working with Cohen
that looks less like a news show and

name:Trevor Noah

text:more like a guy really stressed giving
himself a pep talk it's just like come
on we gotta get buckled up this is gonna
be a rough ride whoo-ha
from Washington no one else is talking
about Sean Hannity today but he's here

name:Trevor Noah

text:any news
all right thanks Tucker I'm just say
this I you're like my brother but I'm
glad for it's like a millisecond the
Heat's off me and on you okay so I
appreciate that you know it says a lot

name:Trevor Noah

text:about your news network when all of your
top anchors are playing scandal tag it
say I made fun of the Parkland kids tag
you're it I know thank God now what what
people already wondering is this
whatever legal advice was why didn't

name:Trevor Noah

text:Hannity get it from his regular attorney
right instead of turning to a guy who
specifically known for paying off
mistresses why did he go to him
but according to Hannity baby this is
not what it looks like to be absolutely

name:Trevor Noah

text:clear they never involved any matter
Annie
sorry to disappoint so many matter
between me or third party a third groups
at all and are my questions exclusively
almost focused on real estate Wow here

name:Trevor Noah

text:any slipped into almost I do you hear it
yeah it was super quick super cookies
like all my questions to Michael Cohen
were exclusively almost real estate
excessively almost exclusively almost
yeah he sounds like the voice at the end

name:Trevor Noah

text:of those medical ads earn ex is
exclusively almost side-effect free
explicitly almost you can't say
exclusively almost exclusively almost is
the kind of phrase that makes people ask
more questions if someone tells you that

name:Trevor Noah

text:they exclusively almost have sex with
adults you're not hiring them to babysit
your kids
that's not what you're thinking of right
now but okay fine okay fine
Hannity claims he was just getting some

name:Trevor Noah

text:informal real estate advice from Michael
Cohen which makes what he said a few
hours earlier on his radio show all the
more confusing I never gave him a
retainer never received an invoice never
paid any any fees you know I might have

name:Trevor Noah

text:handed him ten bucks I definitely want
you turning client privilege on this
something like that okay okay okay whoa
okay wait so he's not your lawyer all
you had was a few chit chats about real
estate but you definitely want to turn a

name:Trevor Noah

text:client privilege yeah you definitely
want that did you bury under that house
no I'm just saying I've had a lot of
conversations about real estate at the
end of it I never went this never
happened

name:Trevor Noah

text:what honey did was so shady even when he
tried to talk about other things on his
show his own guests had to call him out
and please do enjoy foreign national
using Russian sources of all things to
get it is that a crime in Alan

name:Trevor Noah

text:Dershowitz his book well first of all
Shawn I do want to say that I really
think that you should have disclosed
your relationship with Cohen when you
talked about him on this show I think it
would have been much much better had you

name:Trevor Noah

text:disclosed that relationship you were the
nature of it professor I'll deal with
this later on I understand it was
minimal I would understand but he should
have said that and that would have been
fair to say it was such a minor

name:Trevor Noah

text:relationship in terms you should have
said handed you should have said that
I beseech our American lawmakers from
Congress and Senate to stop slinging mud
across the aisle and come up with a
bipartisan solution to an obvious

name:Trevor Noah

text:epidemic of gun violence and mass
shooting in America I think that last
kid is very relatable I too do not wish
to be shot in the face yeah wherever
Malala is right now she's like that's
what I've been saying yeah we're on the

name:Trevor Noah

text:same page now most people who see those
kids are impressed by how articulate
they are and they're inspired by their
passion
other people like ex-congressman and
paid CNN contributor Jack Kingston they

name:Trevor Noah

text:think it's suspicious that these kids
say they don't want to be shot in the
face I think it's a horrible tragedy and
I'm heartbroken but I also know that
their sorrow can very easily be hijacked
by left-wing groups but do you think you

name:Trevor Noah

text:have an agenda well let's ask ourselves
do we really think that and I say this
sincerely do we really think 17 year
olds on their own are gonna plan a
nationwide rally I say this sincerely
get out of here man

name:Trevor Noah

text:[Music]
you think adults can convince teenagers
to do something they don't want to do
really like you think these kids were
actually pro-gun and then what George
Soros showed up and he was like who on

name:Trevor Noah

text:skittles yeah you're shocked that these
kids can plan a few events like this if
this guy had even seen one movie about
high school he wouldn't know that
planning rallies is at least 30% of
being a teenager yeah the other 70% is

name:Trevor Noah

text:falling in love with vampires that's all
it is it is now some pro-gun advocates
are taking the opposite approach all
right they do believe that these kids
are acting without adult supervision
and for them that's exactly the problem

name:Trevor Noah

text:the media's focus more on a teenager's
expertise in supply-side control
measures for guns which Tucker let's be
candid they probably have not studied a
very complicated layered issue yeah you
know what yeah you're right these kids

name:Trevor Noah

text:may not be professors in guns but maybe
being in a mass shooting gets you an
honorary degree yeah maybe just maybe
you realize that if people weren't
allowed to share their opinions unless
they'd studied the issue then Donald

name:Trevor Noah

text:Trump would never be allowed to speak
[Music]
you
why people have a very different
relationship with the police I was
trying to explain this to my friend Dave

name:Trevor Noah

text:you know when we were hanging out he's
like do what is it with black people in
police I'm like it's not black people
don't like the police or hate the police
it's just that just that you have a
tumultuous history with the police one

name:Trevor Noah

text:day we were driving we're driving on the
highway and the police car pulled up
behind us and I got tense I just got
really tense and he's like dude what's
going on I said the police the police
are behind us he was like yeah and did

name:Trevor Noah

text:you do anything wrong I said that's not
the point
because it really isn't for white people
that is the point the police would send
you to jail if you do something wrong as
a black person you have a different

name:Trevor Noah

text:relationship the police may send you to
jail just because I know that because I
was I was driving I got pulled over by
the police for the first time in my life
in America and already I'm not very
comfortable when driving in the United

name:Trevor Noah

text:States you know not because the other
side of the road but because the other
side of the car I'm not used to that
okay
like I always get into the car on the
wrong side I'll be shopping and I'll

name:Trevor Noah

text:come back to my car confidently now I'll
jump inside and put the things down and
I'm like ah
and then instead of getting out I said
they always just sit there because I
always think somebody's watching me so I

name:Trevor Noah

text:just sit there
and I act like I planned it all where is
my driver where's my truck he should
have been here by now well oh well I
guess I'll Drive myself
I don't know why I do that I'm not

name:Trevor Noah

text:comfortable do you have to drive in Los
Angeles so I had a little rental car and
I'm driving on the freeway and this
police car pulls up behind me he drives
me on me for a little bit and then
flashes his lights and I was like oh he

name:Trevor Noah

text:probably wants to go past and so I moved
over to the middle lane and then he came
with me and he flashed his lights again
he came back with me and here's the
fresh line this time he was stopping me
I thought it was basically the vehicular

name:Trevor Noah

text:equivalent of that moment on the
sidewalk when you both don't know which
way to go silly he thought that I was
evading ever because I don't think it's
fair that police have speakers on their
cars and we don't I think this is a

name:Trevor Noah

text:recipe for disaster that's the first
step in mending relationships as
communication people I don't know what
the hell that guy was saying but I
couldn't tell him he was like pulasa
wrong I had a speak I would have had the

name:Trevor Noah

text:ability to be like sure I cannot hear
what you're saying enunciate us please
in Nancy HOH speak clearly use your
words buddy use your words talk to me
talk to me what do you need pull over
pull over I'll be like okay I will be

name:Trevor Noah

text:pulling over right now thank you very
much
but I call over all over panic
and so I stopped I pulled over right
there where I was on the freeway which
apparently you not supposed to do I

name:Trevor Noah

text:didn't know this that knows cuz I just
know that police tell me to do something
I do it so he pull over and then I stop
and then he was like don't pull over
there be more specific
there's more appropriate Yukons itself

name:Trevor Noah

text:Phnom Penh agiza get back into the road
I'm like this guy does not know what he

more bombshells from the special

name:Trevor Noah

text:councils Russia investigation which
means it's time for another installment
of momulla mo problems based on recent
events it feels like the mullah
investigation is finally starting to
wrap up then again it seems like the

name:Trevor Noah

text:mother investigation is always wrapping
up sort of like a phone call with your
mom okay okay bye-bye mom I love what
what yeah yeah no I won't forget okay
yes yes I'll pray for them all right bye
mama

name:Trevor Noah

text:okay I love no mom I told you I don't
watch dr. Phil no mom okay okay yeah
we've all we're breaking up we were no
no no no I'm not breaking up with her
mom I'm just saying the phone no no yes
we're a good mom no no we're not having

name:Trevor Noah

text:kids mom I told you okay okay bye-bye
mom every call anyway
people think the investigation might
soon end because Marla and federal
prosecutors in New York have started
recommending punishments for some of the

name:Trevor Noah

text:people involved people like Michael
Flynn the former national security
adviser and Michael Cohen former Trump
lawyer and Shady Cramer so until now the
only people incriminates it have been
Trump's henchmen but then on Friday

name:Trevor Noah

text:got real for the first time a separate
filing by the Southern District of New
York directly implicates mr. Trump in
felonies involving hush money payments
coordinated by his former attorney
Michael Cohen to Karen McDougal and

name:Trevor Noah

text:stormy Daniels for alleged affairs
prosecutors allege that he was trying to
secretly manipulate the election by
buying the silence of alleged mistresses
ahead of the campaign that's right the
president has been implicated in

name:Trevor Noah

text:multiple felonies let that sink in a
little more little more okay too much
too much take it back a little yeah just
there that's perfect and just to be
clear this isn't even the collusion with
Russia thing right or the obstruction of

name:Trevor Noah

text:justice thing we haven't even gotten to
those yet these felonies are about Trump
paying hush money to his mistresses and
if you think about it it's weird how
much politics and porn are overlapping
right now all right cuz in the future

name:Trevor Noah

text:kids will be doing their American
history homework on pornhub that's what
it means right we like don't come in mom
I'm learning about the president
and what's hilarious is how the
prosecutors tried to give Trump cover by

name:Trevor Noah

text:referring to him in these documents as
individual one but it's obvious who it
is because they also say individual one
became presidents of the United States
hey how much Kira can you get it's like
individual one who tweets every day at

name:Trevor Noah

text:3:00 a.m. or individual one who is
totally embarrassed by his idiot son
individual one junior but it's pretty
clear by now Trump is in some deep
and he has to know it's getting serious
because people on TV are saying so

name:Trevor Noah

text:implicated will House Democrats push to
impeach the president the president has
now stepped into the same territory that
ultimately led to president nixon
resigning the office certainly they'd be
impeachable offenses because even though

name:Trevor Noah

text:they were committed before the president
became president they were committed in
in in in the service of fraudulently
obtaining the office there's a very real
prospect that on the day donald trump
leaves office the justice department may

name:Trevor Noah

text:indict him that he may be the first
president in quite some time to face the
real prospect of jail time he's got it
know his future looks like it's behind
bars unless he cuts some sort of deal
with the prosecutors that's right

name:Trevor Noah

text:things are so serious people are talking
about President Trump going to prison
and I know I know many people might want
to see Trump in prison but not me okay I
do not want to see Trump go to prison
mostly because if you put Trump in a

name:Trevor Noah

text:prison jumpsuit it'll just look like
he's naked
and why should we be punished for his
crimes but even though even though many
legal experts are saying this could land
Trump in prison there's one person who

name:Trevor Noah

text:watches a lot of law and order who
totally disagrees the president has an
interesting take on the damning
documents on Twitter he writes quote
totally clear as the president thank you
exclamation point you've got to give it

name:Trevor Noah

text:to President Trump no matter what
happens to him he's always positive
he'll never admit defeat like he's gonna
be in the handcuffs in the back of the
cop car he'd be like driver thank you
for the lovely silver bracelets now take

opportunity and it's an obligation I

yourself anyone who's who has a platform
has an opportunity to use that not only

text:to entertain people but to engage in
ideas you what do you care about what

[Music]
from Comedy Central's World News

[Music]
discrimination there is a firestorm
tonight over what happened three days
ago at a Starbucks in Philadelphia where
the police were called in and two black

name:Trevor Noah

text:men were arrested this video captured by
witnesses cell phone shows police
talking and later handcuffing the men
while they were waiting for a friend how
crazy is this two men arrested for
waiting to meet someone at Starbucks you

name:Trevor Noah

text:see this this year this is why black
people should always show up late if
you're early it's loitering for our
safety black people we show up late
everywhere we go in fact maybe there's
got me thinking maybe it's not true that

name:Trevor Noah

text:black people are never on time it's just
that we only know about the ones who
show up late because all the early ones
got taken away maybe that's what it is
and I know I know I know there were some
people saying well why were these guys

name:Trevor Noah

text:in Starbucks doing nothing huh why well
because that's what Starbucks is for
everyone is doing nothing
Starbucks is basically a bus station
with espresso machines that's all it is
in fact the only mistake these black

name:Trevor Noah

text:guys made was not using the tactics of
the white man that's what they did yeah
when the manager accused them of doing
nothing nothing they should have replied
actually I'm writing a screenplay that's
what I'm doing but look if I if I can

name:Trevor Noah

text:get serious for just a minute here I
will say this do you like do you have
any idea what it does to a person's
dignity to be arrested by bike cops huh
think about this think about this
someone calls the cops on you and

name:Trevor Noah

text:instead of driving up with sirens
wailing Oh badass they like evening
ding-ding-ding
and how do they even get you back to the
station huh
do they throw you on the back of a

name:Trevor Noah

text:bicycle built for two and now now you're
in custody but you have to help them
peddle bullshit well for real though for
real though America clearly has a
problem with policing and black people
on the one hand you have people calling

name:Trevor Noah

text:the police because they see black people
as inherently threatening and then you
have police who only know how to respond
to a call with an arrest or violence so
the question is what do we do do we fix
society or do we try and fix the police

name:Trevor Noah

text:well the coffee chain just announced it
will be closing more than 8,000 of his
stores in the US it's for racial bias
training for nearly a hundred and
seventy-five thousand employees I'm
embarrassed ashamed I think what

name:Trevor Noah

text:occurred was reprehensible at every
single level I think I take it very
personally as everyone in our company
does and we're committed to making it
right that was a really great interview
it's just a shame that when it ended

name:Trevor Noah

text:Gayle King was arrested for not ordering
a coffee no no but seriously though I
want to say props to Starbucks right as
a company they didn't just apologize
they actually doing something about it
and I think that's a pretty cool thing

name:Trevor Noah

text:and I bet from now on they're gonna be a
lot more careful when it comes to
dealing with race
hello Starbucks employees I'm here today
because you've done that's fine after
today's training those racial

name:Trevor Noah

text:insensitivity z' will be a thing of the
past but first the words of the black
employees watching you good my dude take
off the only gotta watch Magnus straight
now for everyone else we'll be reviewing
how to handle some common scenarios that

name:Trevor Noah

text:occur inside of the Starbucks
when an african-american customer enters
your store is a right way to greet him
and a wrong way here's some of the wrong
ways no sup man can I get the oh I'm
sorry so we got out of grape drink

name:Trevor Noah

text:here's the correct way to greet a black
person in your store hello let's move on
with writing black Mane's on coffee cups
okay miss Vince a lot c is for Shonda
roshanda of course of course
here's what he should have done it's

name:Trevor Noah

text:roshanda oh I'm sorry I have this
disease where I forget how to read would
you mind spelling it for me sure finally
let's address one of our more sensitive
issues bathroom access from time to time
Starbucks customers will need to

name:Trevor Noah

text:evacuate their bowels it's a natural
part of the coffee process but we must
be sensitive about it
pardon me may I get the code to the
restroom oh you ain't bout nothing you
ain't get no snack no no you just think

name:Trevor Noah

text:you're gonna walk up in here and take a
shit for free for free listen I got a
blog called number one on your ass why I
let you ruin these white folks toilet
unemployed piss here's a better approach
hey pardon me sir

name:Trevor Noah

text:may get the code to the restroom
absolutely the code is zero 115 it's dr.
King's birthday
and there you have it now you know how
to make african-americans feel welcome
at Starbucks thanks for watching and

name:Trevor Noah

text:remember don't be racist situation at
Starbucks we've heard multiple stories
about people getting the cops called on
them for being black in public but
yesterday's story might be the craziest
five women claimed that they are victims

name:Trevor Noah

text:of racial profiling after they say the
owners of a Pennsylvania golf course
asked the group to leave the course
women say workers at Grandview Golf Club
kicked them out halfway through the game
when the workers said that the women

name:Trevor Noah

text:were playing too slow you know what the
problem in America is is that white
people call the police like they're
asking for the manager it's like this is
unsound acceptable unacceptable I didn't
I demand to see someone who might shoot

name:Trevor Noah

text:you come on not luckily in this case the
police handled it correctly you know and
there were no arrests in fact I like to
think the police only showed up because
they didn't believe that there were five
black women playing golf like Marty

name:Trevor Noah

text:bring the camera this is gonna be insane
like I'm glad that nothing happened to
the women but I would like to hear the
sports cost for that if only there was
an announcer who was like okay show
their ting up and oh oh a race war is

name:Trevor Noah

text:breaking out on the fourth hole these
douchebags have never seen black women
before all the cops have let them go
very nice
Yale University officials say they're
deeply troubled by racially sensitive

name:Trevor Noah

text:incident involving two grad students but
late a Seon bola who is black shot video
of a white student who'd call campus
police on her cm bola had fallen asleep
in the common room of their building the
other woman thought she was an intruder

name:Trevor Noah

text:come on man this white lady called the
cops because she saw a black woman
sleeping sleeping that's literally the
least threatening thing a person can do
I mean what did she tell the cops yeah I
know she's sleeping but who knows what

name:Trevor Noah

text:she could be dreaming of I mean this
could be dangerous the last time they
had a dream we have to let them vote get
over here quick
[Applause]
and the worst part is she was sleeping

name:Trevor Noah

text:because she was tired because Starbucks
wouldn't sell her coffee this morning a
California woman is facing outrage
online after a now viral video shows her
allegedly calling police on an
eight-year-old black girl selling

name:Trevor Noah

text:bottles of water with her mother on a
sidewalk she called police on an
eight-year-old little girl you could
hide all you want the woman identified
as Alison IDO now being dubbed on social
media as permit Patti come on the story

name:Trevor Noah

text:please welcome our very own Dulce Sloan
everybody will say another story of a
white person calling 911 on a black
person doing nothing what are your
thoughts Trevor I'm so sick of this
bullshit a lot of people felt that this

name:Trevor Noah

text:example was particularly egregious
because this woman was calling the cops
on a child yeah but what really made me
mad is the way she did it play that
video again this woman don't want to let
a little girl stuff some water she

name:Trevor Noah

text:called the police on an eight-year-old
little girl you hide all you want the
whole world don't see you booth why is
she trying to crash behind the wall like
a white privilige ninja
the hell are you doing we just saw you

name:Trevor Noah

you don't disappear just because you
ducked down black people in the
dinosaurs from Jurassic Park
[Applause]
Dulce permit pati

name:Trevor Noah

text:was interviewed by the San Francisco
Chronicle and she said that she didn't
actually call the cops yeah she says she
was just pretending to call them Oh
Trevor that makes it worse because that
means she didn't actually care about the

name:Trevor Noah

text:permits she wanted to scare an eight
year old black girl into thinking that
the cops were coming she knows black
people are afraid of the cops and she
used it as a weapon against them that's
tough imagine how white people would

name:Trevor Noah

text:feel if black people ran around
threatening them with gluten
[Applause]
I understand why you're upset to say but
I think you'll be glad to know that this
story has a happy ending right now this

name:Trevor Noah

text:girl was selling water because she was
trying to raise money for a trip to
Disneyland well guess what after black
Twitter broke the story somebody bought
that girl four tickets to Disneyland
oh look at God look at God

name:Trevor Noah

text:oh but whatever she does she better not
try to sell water there did he don't
around a recent online survey found that
only 8% of American high school seniors
could identify slavery as the central
cause of the Civil War yeah and even

name:Trevor Noah

text:worse ten percent say the winners of the
Civil War was Captain America that's
scary and this seems like an insane
statistic but when you see how some
schools try and teach slavery you'll
understand why a homework assignment

name:Trevor Noah

text:given out this week at a charter school
in San Antonio has set off an uproar the
students were instructed to make a list
of the negative and positive aspects of
slavery this is the paper Robert lavars
eighth grade son was given to fill out

name:Trevor Noah

text:in a history class you can see his son
wrote not applicable on the side labeled
positive aspects and wrote a long list
of negative aspects Robert says there's
no excuse for this assignment okay first
of all that kid gets an A for life cuz

name:Trevor Noah

text:that assignment is horrible like that
assignment is so bad it almost seems
like a trap to find the racist kids in
class it's like okay kids what were the
positive aspects of slavery I know cheap
labor trick question go to detention

name:Trevor Noah

text:yeah little Grand Wizard
and it gets worse it gets worse because
these insane lessons on slavery have
spread into other subjects somehow
connect County parents are outraged
tonight over third grade math homework

name:Trevor Noah

text:it referenced slaves picking fruit and
violence one problem say each tree had
56 oranges if eight slaves picked them
equally then how much would each slave
pick then there was another if Frederick
got two beatings per day how many

name:Trevor Noah

text:beatings did he get in one week okay
okay first of all two beatings times
seven that's fourteen beatings but
secondly slavery is too serious to just
casually drop into math problems and by
the way I'm not just worried about how

name:Trevor Noah

text:inappropriate those questions are I'm
worried about how it's escalating like
first is just picking oranges next its
beatings you know if the next question
starts out with eight men and white
robes show up to Frederick's House Ron

name:Trevor Noah

text:so look obviously these assignments
aren't treating slavery with the weights
it deserves but it turns out some
teachers go too far in the opposite
direction
she singled out black students told them

name:Trevor Noah

text:to lie on the floor and stepped on their
backs to show them quote how it is to be
a slave a controversial lesson about
slavery has been pulled from a Cerritos
High School a mother complained recently
after getting this email staff would act

name:Trevor Noah

text:as slave ship captains the email
described and the children's slaves they
used masking tape to tie their wrists
together make them lay on the ground and
in a dark room have them watch a clip
from the film roots people Hey look I

name:Trevor Noah

text:know I know some people say Trevor no
these teachers are just just trying to
be creative and how they teach like I
get that I get them but here's my
question
how come teachers only seem to get

name:Trevor Noah

text:creative like this with slavery right it
doesn't happen with any other historical
subject like they they never like hey
Connor
because you're Irish I'm gonna take away
your lunch so you can learn about the

name:Trevor Noah

text:potato famine I never say that
and then also this thing of like
justifying bad things in history you
know you never hear the teachers asking
kids to write an essay on why the
iceberg was good for the Titanic or

name:Trevor Noah

text:asking for three reasons why those
people deserve to be eaten by Jeffrey
Dahmer like all I'm saying is if you're
gonna teach slavery that way teach it
all the way or at the very least if
you're gonna teach slavery this way and

name:Trevor Noah

text:the lesson on a high note you know if
you tie the kids up and make them watch
roots then afterwards they get to watch
Django Unchained and what the teachers
ask we all know that yesterday Roseanne
was fired for tweeting that former Obama

name:Trevor Noah

text:advisor Valerie Jarrett was the birth
child of the Muslim Brotherhood and the
planet of the apes and many people
applauded ABC for reacting swiftly and
canceling Roseanne now Roseanne getting
fired wasn't a shock because I mean

name:Trevor Noah

text:let's be honest comparing a black person
to an ape is what I like to call shit
your pants racism right it's so obvious
it's obviously bad you know like
everyone can smell it everyone can see
it no one wants to help you clean it up

name:Trevor Noah

text:even the anti PC Brigade agreed Roseanne
had gone too far Roseanne Barr made some
really incendiary pretty appalling
comments on
the plan of the Apes was so over the
line there was no getting away from that

name:Trevor Noah

text:the Muslim Brotherhood that gets kicked
around but when you combine that with
the plan of the Apes it's just so toxic
it's just you can't really ever come
back wow that's an interesting angle
I love how precise Jesse Watters gets

name:Trevor Noah

text:with this it's like he's a racism
chemist look on its own Muslim
Brotherhood is harmless
yeah but ANSI that's an ANSI Muslim slur
but once you combine it with too much
plan of the age it's gonna blow up in

name:Trevor Noah

text:your face trust me when you've been
saying racist shit as long as I have you
got a feel for it you know youyou got a
feel you got to mix it just right and
what was really fun was was watching the
people who tried to argue that Roseanne

name:Trevor Noah

text:wasn't being racist she was just sort of
generally bad we live in a politically
correct world right now we live in a
world where it's just not it's just
plain not nice it's not nice to say
let's just look at what this was and

name:Trevor Noah

text:what she said that the tweet was was not
nice it was ugly
it was demeaning it was gross and let's
just leave it at that
why what's wrong why yeah why why don't
even have been let's just leave it at

name:Trevor Noah

text:that I want that lady to defend me in
courts murder is such a harsh word can't
we all agree to call it making someone
go bye-bye this is such a PC war where
no one wants to die anymore huh and
seriously I'm impressed by all of this

name:Trevor Noah

text:it takes a lot of mental strength to say
that calling a black woman an ape isn't
racist not everyone can pull it off do
you think Rosen's a racist I don't think
so no I've seen her show many times when
she was in her previous show I don't

name:Trevor Noah

text:think she's a racist I think she makes
me comments that she didn't think about
that would come across as sounding
racist and indeed they were
this is magic it's like he's
conservative side and he's black side

name:Trevor Noah

text:we're fighting it out in his head and
he's black side one at the last minute
she made some comments that might sound
racist because that shit was racist
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
whoa

name:Trevor Noah

text:now Kanye West is defending himself
against really the indefensible
he said slavery was a choice here's the
sound you hear about slavery for 400
years for 400 years that's sound like a
choice

name:Trevor Noah

text:just just me so kanye west's popped up
at TMZ's offices and decided to
freestyle some history lessons
thankfully TMZ stafa van Lathan was
there to call Kanye Alton personal
producer van Lathan taking West to task

name:Trevor Noah

text:about the slavery comment while you are
making music and being an artist the
rest of us in society have to deal with
these threats to our lives frankly I'm
disappointed I'm appalled and brother I
am unbelievably hurt by the fact that

name:Trevor Noah

text:you have morphed into something to me
that's not real Wow I was powerful I was
really really powerful and you know
there was one scared white person in
that office who was like hello police
two black people arguing in that office

name:Trevor Noah

text:right yeah
[Applause]
you know normally I I wouldn't really
care what Kanye West said about slavery
or black history but what does suck is
that now every member of the tiki torch

name:Trevor Noah

text:Club out there is gonna use Kanye's
words to justify their hates you know
basically the way Kanye samples
old-school soul music is how racists are
gonna sample him now
it'll be like black folks at choices

name:Trevor Noah

text:like slavery so look
Kanye may think he's just being a free
thinker but the truth is there's nothing
good coming out of this except maybe
maybe an idea for a new movie
that servant that don't obey his law

name:Trevor Noah

text:shall be beaten with many stripes love
my job
[Music]
hey y'all ready to pick some cotton I

you
North Korea when President Obama left
office he warned Donald Trump that Kim

name:Trevor Noah

text:Jong Un's nuclear threat would be his
biggest challenge
well that and learning to read but
mostly the nuclear challenge and after
Trump's second summit with the North
Korean snowman it turns out Obama may

name:Trevor Noah

text:have been right
breaking news no deal president Trump's
high-stakes nuclear talks with Kim
jong-un suddenly break down overnight
president Trump beginning an eight
thousand mile journey home from Hanoi

name:Trevor Noah

text:empty-handed sometimes you have to walk
and this was just one of those times no
concessions no deal no final photo-op a
closing ceremony scheduled to celebrate
an agreement scrapped even lunch was
canceled with the table already sent Wow

name:Trevor Noah

text:you know something must have gone wrong
when these two turned down lunch Wow
although I bet after they left the room
kim jongwan came back and he was like ah
can I get this lunch to go please
there's a lot of hungry people in my

name:Trevor Noah

text:country and I want to eat this in front
of them yeah but yes after months of
anticipation nuclear talks between the
u.s. and North Korea have completely
broken down and I don't know about you
but I was shocked because my boy Trump

name:Trevor Noah

text:has been telling us that he and Kim
jong-un are good I mean like real good I
mean we have a good chemistry together
kim jonghwan we have a great chairman
Kim we have a great chemistry I like him
he likes me the relationship is good I

name:Trevor Noah

text:will go back and forth and then we fell
in love
okay no really he wrote me beautiful
letters and they're great letters we
fell in love you see you see Trump and
Kim fell in love and I know that sounds

name:Trevor Noah

text:weird but when you think about it Kim
Jong Hwan is totally Donald Trump's type
right all of trumps best relationships
are with people who are half his age and
don't speak English it works that's when
the relationship be best that's what I'm

name:Trevor Noah

text:saying
and I'll be honest I'll be honest when
this summit started it seemed like love
was still in the air the day started
with the promise of a deal to get rid of
the regime's nuclear weapons president

name:Trevor Noah

text:johnson kim jonghwan are really enjoying
their a long time the two leaders took a
walk around the pool at the historic
metropole hotel Kim for the first time
took questions from the Western press
that's right

name:Trevor Noah

text:things are going so well there for the
first time ever Kim jong-un took a
question from the Western press and he
answered with swag you heard him I like
you do you plan to do it he's like if I
wasn't plan to do it I wouldn't be here

name:Trevor Noah

text:yeah that's amazing that's progress cuz
I mean in North Korea when a reporter
asks him a question his response is
usually great question feed him to the
Lions and then feed the Lions to me they
wouldn't give me that lunch to go so if

name:Trevor Noah

text:everything started out great what turned
their love affair sour well it's the
same thing that turns most relationships
our they both just wanted different
things the u.s. was hoping for more
concrete steps from Pyongyang towards a

name:Trevor Noah

text:deal that is verifiable and enforceable
there was a fundamental disagreement Kim
jong-un wants the crushing sanctions on
his country lifted before dismantling
his nuclear program basically they
wanted the sanctions lifted in their

name:Trevor Noah

text:entirety and we couldn't do that they
were willing to dhenuka large portion of
the areas that we wanted but we couldn't
give up all of the sanctions for that oh
man so that's what happened Kim wants a
trump to give everything up but before

name:Trevor Noah

text:he did Trump wanted guarantees in
exchange classic relationship dilemma
Trump was like Kim if I'm gonna open my
trade to you then we need to make this
official Kim was like a fish shield why
we got to put labels on this baby we

name:Trevor Noah

text:have fun isn't that all that matters
women they remember our trip to
Singapore come on man don't was like I
know but it's just that people are
saying you're taking advantage of me
I'm always flying to you you never

name:Trevor Noah

text:flying to me it's like Donny Donny baby
I told you man once my economy takes off
I'll be flying to you all the time man
you think I just don't understand why
you won't let me check your nuclear
sites it's like oh you don't trust me

name:Trevor Noah

text:man you don't trust me Donny if I say
there's no nukes there's no nukes man
you want to check my sights fine
check the sights no I was like okay
think no you're not gonna check my
sights

name:Trevor Noah

text:there's no love without trust Donny that
was a test
China was right about you I'm out we're
gonna was like no give way I need to
build a wall around my heart that's how
it all went down

name:Trevor Noah

text:and now even though Kim jong-un made
Trump fly to the other side of the world
for nothing
Trump still believes that they can work
things out when we walked away it was a
very friendly walk we shook hands we you

name:Trevor Noah

text:know there's a there's a warmth that we
have now I hope that stays I think it
will I want to keep the relationship and
we will keep the relationship we'll see
what happens over the next period of
time

name:Trevor Noah

text:Oh shame Donnell this is so tough to
watch ma'am because we thought we've all
been there we really have all been there
you told your friends this was gonna
work out and despite the warnings you
still carried on and now you're trying

name:Trevor Noah

text:to save face because you think
everyone's judging you which we totally
are but instead of dragging the South
Donald I think it's time to accept that
maybe just maybe Kim is just not that
into you

name:Trevor Noah

text:[Music]
you
there are a lot of things that President
Trump inherited from President Obama
that we know he hates the Affordable
Care Act the White House vegetable

name:Trevor Noah

text:garden the container of cocoa butter
Obama left behind in the bathroom he's
like this is terrible doesn't taste like
cocoa or butter no I got for Trump
probably hates it the most was the
intelligence officials who stayed on

name:Trevor Noah

text:after Obama left do you think any
intelligence agencies US intelligence
agencies are out to get you well
certainly in the past it's been terrible
you look at Brennan you look at clapper
you look at Hayden you look at Comey you

name:Trevor Noah

text:look at McCabe you look at struck and
his lover
Lisa page it's so it's so cute how Trump
lists all the members of the deep state
like they're Santa's reindeer you know
he's like you know Brennan and clapper

name:Trevor Noah

text:and Hayden and Comey but do you recall
the most famous all loves everybody
Peter struck and Lisa Paige but after
cleaning house and firing his enemies
Trump's intelligence community is now
led completely by people he hand-picked

name:Trevor Noah

text:although after yesterday he might want
to pick again tonight top US
intelligence officials are openly
contradicting president Trump's
assessment of some of America's most
dangerous adversaries on Iran US

name:Trevor Noah

text:intelligence agencies say Tehran is
still not restarting its nuclear program
at the moment technically they're in
compliance President Trump today
launching a remarkable series of attacks
on his own top intelligence officials he

name:Trevor Noah

text:calls them quote extremely passive and
naive about Iran saying that the United
States needs to be careful and
suggesting get this perhaps intelligence
should go back to school go back to
school the intelligence community

name:Trevor Noah

text:doesn't need to go back to school their
intelligence they know more than anyone
like realize they know what's in the
presidential daily briefing not even the
president knows what's in that
but I do understand why Trump's mad

name:Trevor Noah

text:because yesterday his own intelligence
officials said that everything he
believes is bullshit a striking
difference over one of the biggest
issues looming over the White House
Russia I have president putin he just

name:Trevor Noah

text:said it's not Russia I will say this I
don't see any reason why it would be we
expect Russia will continue to wage its
information war against democracies and
to use social media to attempt to divide
our societies and Don Isis we have won

name:Trevor Noah

text:against Isis Isis isn't is intent on
resurging and still commands thousands
of fighters in Iraq and Syria
wow that is awkward especially the part
about Isis because when he claimed
victory Trump was basically spiking the

name:Trevor Noah

text:football and now the officials are like
no we've reviewed the touchdown we're
calling it back also we worried about
your head trauma because you've been
saying some crazy shit and the most
painful contradiction of all might have

name:Trevor Noah

text:been their differences over North Korea
and we have a good relationship with Kim
Jong no more rockets no more missiles no
more nuclear testing
we currently assess that North Korea
will seek to retain its WMD capabilities

name:Trevor Noah

text:and is unlikely to completely give up
its nuclear weapons and production
capabilities the regime is committed to
developing a long-range nuclear or
missile that would pose a direct threat
to the United States oh man this is

name:Trevor Noah

text:heartbreaking guys Trump is running
around on the streets saying he loves
Kim and how much they're in love and now
his intelligence team is telling the
whole world that Kim's not that into him
the only way this would be more

name:Trevor Noah

text:humiliating as if Trump tried to hold
Kim's hand in public and Kim just
swatted it away
hashtag never forget but look good look
after yesterday it's very clear there's
two totally different views of the

name:Trevor Noah

text:threats facing America today and the
American people you have to make a
choice are you gonna believe the heads
of the CIA the FBI and the Director of
National Intelligence or the guy who
doesn't believe in global waving

name:Trevor Noah

text:[Music]
you
from Comedy Central's World News
headquarters in New York
[Music]
there's a new report tonight the

name:Trevor Noah

text:president Trump may have lied his way on
to Forbes magazine annual list of
richest Americans back in the 1980s
Trump first made the list in 1982 with a
reported net worth of a hundred million
dollars but the documents later proved

name:Trevor Noah

text:he was only worth five million dollars
he lied about how many apartments the
Trump Organization owned how much the
units were worth and that Trump not his
father owned the apartments that's right
all the way back in 1982 Trump

name:Trevor Noah

text:apparently got onto the very first
Forbes list by lying about his net worth
and claiming that the stuff that his dad
owned was actually his which is a
classic lie every twenty-year-old would
recognize you know it's like let's get

name:Trevor Noah

text:out of here girl I got my own place
above my dad's garage now Trump lying to
Forbes because he's me it could easily
be seen as just someone trying to boost
his ego but it turns out that trumps lie
may have gotten him a whole lot more

name:Trevor Noah

text:than just some flattering press because
Donald never had an actual statement of
his assets and his liabilities he used
the Forbes 400 and this statement of
inflated assets to borrow billions and
billions of dollars which he used to

name:Trevor Noah

text:build Atlantic City and over leveraged
himself you're saying he wanted to use
the Forbes list to fraudulently induced
people to fund him in ways they
otherwise would not that's correct okay
I don't know about you but this is

name:Trevor Noah

text:mind-blowing
Trump lied to get onto the Forbes list
then the Forbes list cemented him as a
mogul and then he used his mogul status
to get to the White House
because remember his success story

name:Trevor Noah

text:wasn't just a minor detail of who he was
it was the very heart of his campaign
Forbes just came out and they said I'm
worth four and a half four five billion
dollars I'm really rich I'm not even
saying that in a braggart that's the

name:Trevor Noah

text:kind of mindset that's the kind of
thinking you need for this country so
look I'm really a good businessman I'm
so good at business Oh
people are gonna be so rich so fast you
don't even you don't know how rich

name:Trevor Noah

text:you're gonna be you're gonna go from a
debtor nation it's gonna be you you're
gonna say wow what happened you know in
retrospect I feel like we should have
asked for penis turns out Pew was a
Muslim bad who would have thought you

name:Trevor Noah

text:may remember that during the
presidential campaign Donald Trump had a
number of ambitious goals like bringing
back coal jobs and launching Hillary at
the moon but perhaps his most grandiose
goal was this you're a deal person right

name:Trevor Noah

text:the ultimate deal is that deal Israel
Palestine you are you're gonna make it
that probably is the hardest deal there
is to make if I'm gonna be President I'd
rather be in a position because I will
try the best I can and I'm a very good

name:Trevor Noah

text:deal maker I believe me to try and solve
that puzzle you're not gonna solve it if
you're gonna be on one side or another
everyone understands them now first of
all first of all props to Trump for
thinking that the ultimate deal is peace

name:Trevor Noah

text:in the Middle East and not the number
four at McDonald's that's a step up I
like that and also I'm in Preston how
confidence he was I bet in his head he
was just thinking all I gotta do is have
Michael Cohen paid the Palestinians 130

name:Trevor Noah

text:thousand dollars and then poof problem
solved no problem folks and to be honest
this is one of those issues where part
of me was willing to give Trump a chance
I mean Israel and Palestine have been
fighting for 70 years right in my head I

name:Trevor Noah

text:was like what's the worst thing Trump
could do well today he answered that
question the Trump administration of
ending decades of established American
policy officially moving the US Embassy
in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem

name:Trevor Noah

text:that added fuel to the fire of weeks of
Palestinian protests along the Gaza
border more than 50 Palestinians killed
by the Israeli military more than 2,000
injured now I don't care who you are I
think we can all agree this was a

name:Trevor Noah

text:horrible loss of life that sadly anyone
could have predicted these ratings and
the Palestinians both claimed Jerusalem
as their capital so
America moving its embassy to Jerusalem
before even holding peace talks was

name:Trevor Noah

text:bound to be a provocative move and there
was a moment where Trump considered not
doing it but not out of concern for the
human cost they said sir
we're building an embassy in Jerusalem
sir I said how much something other

name:Trevor Noah

text:presidents don't ask but that's
something they said I kid you not they
said sir
1 billion dollars I said a billion you
know what a billion dollars is so I
called David I'd stop signing by the way

name:Trevor Noah

text:I had Donald do an Ald and then it was
like dead ball and then all of a sudden
I stopped never got to the tee and I
started putting excess cos I was afraid
that somebody could say it was my
signature and as angry as the

name:Trevor Noah

text:Palestinians are too many Israelis Trump
is a hero the Israeli people also
celebrating the occasion pro-trump signs
a signal of president Trump's growing
popularity in the country the mayor of
Jerusalem has put up an image of the old

name:Trevor Noah

text:wall it actually shows an animated US
flag and Israeli flags the large soccer
club is changing its name to honor the
president the bait our Jerusalem
football club will now be known as bait
our Trump Jerusalem's that's right Trump

name:Trevor Noah

text:has gotten so popular that they're
naming an Israeli soccer team after him
which is perfect because a lot of people
don't know this but that team only won
their league because James Comey stepped
in and tripped a play on the opposing

name:Trevor Noah

text:team
yeah everyone was confused though like
what is James Comey doing here they're
like I don't know Trevor needed him for
the joke and here's the thing if Trump
wants to take Israel's side that's his

name:Trevor Noah

text:prerogative but at least be honest about
it right instead of stoking the flames
at the same time you're saying this our
greatest hope is for peace the United
States remains fully committed to
facilitating a lasting peace agreement

name:Trevor Noah

text:if you're Palestinian you probably think
that statement is absolute and
I can understand why because essentially
although America says it's the referee
it's basically just showing up to game
two in a Cavs Jersey as Ike yeah I'm

name:Trevor Noah

text:gonna be totally fair right LeBron Wang
Wang down to that breaking news those
three Americans who have been held by
North Korea they are now back in the
United States just after 3:00 a.m. the
three American prisoners released from

name:Trevor Noah

text:North Korea stepped out of that plane
and into a made-for-tv moment produced
by the President himself one saying it's
like a dream
wow what a happy ending and I can see
where one of these guys said it's like a

name:Trevor Noah

text:dream because one of these prisoners was
taken during the Obama administration
and now he's like wait the apprentice
guy is president is this a dream but
still but still let's not hate
congratulations to president Trump for

name:Trevor Noah

text:getting these men freed yeah and I
honestly mean it I mean it their
families will be happy to have them back
their spy agencies will also be happy to
have them back and I think we can all
agree that it's a great moments and we

name:Trevor Noah

text:can also agree that Donald Trump can
make a really great moment very weird
John really was excellent to these three
incredible people it's very early in the
morning I think you probably broke the
all-time in history television rating

name:Trevor Noah

text:for three o'clock in the morning that I
would say you know only Trump could be
thinking about TV ratings in the middle
of a hostages coming home party I like
it's 3:00 a.m.
who cares about ratings like the Donald

name:Trevor Noah

text:Trump have a rivalry with the lady from
the pasta boat infomercial are you doing
it's also strange that Trump said Kim
jong-un was excellent to the prisoners
it's almost like they were the hostages
but Trump is the one with Stockholm

name:Trevor Noah

text:Syndrome he was very nice so nice I love
him and I'm happy that these guys are
home you know they went through a lot
physical abuse emotional abuse they were
forced to eat disgusting food in a
cramped space where they couldn't move

name:Trevor Noah

text:their arms and legs and that was just
their flight back on Spirit Airlines a
North Korean labor camp in the sky I'm
hereby directing the Department of
Defense and Pentagon to immediately
begin the process necessary to establish

name:Trevor Noah

text:a space force as the sixth branch of the
Armed Forces that's a big statement we
are going to have the Air Force and we
are going to have the space force
separate but equal' there's no place
like space the space force base force

name:Trevor Noah

text:I don't even know I don't even know
where to start
right he just cancelled military
exercises on the Korean Peninsula
because they were too expensive
now he's literally blasting that money

name:Trevor Noah

text:into space the same guy
I don't top of that I don't if you pick
that up but separate-but-equal yeah why
would he say that it's almost like Trump
is sneaking racist Easter eggs into his
presidency now he's like and introducing

name:Trevor Noah

text:the mascot for space force
Jim the crow everybody the nation's
media may be focused on kids and cages
being ripped apart from their families
at the border but down here in Trump
country they only wanted to talk about

name:Trevor Noah

text:one thing we need Facebook making space
great again I am so excited about space
or there was just one question what is
space for us something we've been
missing for a long time good to go to
space space for us is a little bit of

name:Trevor Noah

text:everything it's like the cast of Modern
Family there you go isn't it fun to say
it's a safe space for us space for the
next generation it's exciting isn't it
what is it it is what they refer to as
cloud computer so space force is items

name:Trevor Noah

text:it's where all my music is yeah I agree
it's not been what is space force you
know space exploration and yeah um just
finding out what's out there I guess but
NASA does space exploration NASA is only
gonna tell us what they want us to know

name:Trevor Noah

text:whereas I think Trump will send his own
stuff and we will find out the truth who
would leave space for Smeal Armstrong
okay
I mean he is dead we have to bring him
back to life I think but the military

name:Trevor Noah

text:has advised President Trump that we
don't need a space force Trump says then
man be more and and he's gonna tell us
the truth about what's out there when
you're in Trump's universe everyone
loves space force but why do we need

name:Trevor Noah

text:space force terrorists could through the
use of drones get into space and become
a very dangerous hazard to freedom I'm
sure that there will be war in space
let's not forget 9/11 okay I think that
space force could help prevent the next

name:Trevor Noah

text:9/11 which would be 9 12 9 12 13 I think
Isis could get to space space Isis space
Isis right space Isis but do we really
need a space force doesn't make a lot of
sense and would be less than a lot of
dollars but at the same time it's just

name:Trevor Noah

text:gonna be cool we need to have a space
for us it's gonna be a waste of money
yeah but it's gonna be cool right so we
need to have you stand by that statement
and by the statement hardpan yeah space
for us pretty much pretty much we need

name:Trevor Noah

text:regulations in space because you can do
whatever you want isn't Trump against
regulation yeah yeah I just stuttered
myself here you know what space force
it's just a cool name it's this cool
name and that's good enough

text:breaking news today Justice Anthony
Kennedy the crucial swing vote on the
Supreme Court for years is retiring
setting the stage for a fierce battle
over the future of the highest court in
all the land when Justice Kennedy steps

name:Trevor Noah

text:down at the end of next month July the
31st the court will be split for liberal
justices and for conservatives President
Trump now has the chance to give
conservatives a solid majority one that
in theory could last for many decades

name:Trevor Noah

text:that's right people
Justice Kennedy officially resigned and
the reason this is so big is that
Kennedy was without question the most
powerful justice on the court and not
just because he can deadlift 650 pounds

name:Trevor Noah

text:but also because while he was generally
conservative Kennedy did sometimes vote
with liberals right he votes it in favor
of gay rights the women's rights choose
and affirmative action and he was the
deciding vote now Trump will likely

name:Trevor Noah

text:replace him with the Justice who would
discriminate and dismantle abortion
rights and LGBTQ rights and that that
sound you're hearing right now that's
Mike Pence having his first orgasm yeah
I cast you out see man the landscape of

name:Trevor Noah

text:American justice is shifting
dramatically tonight on news that 81
year old Supreme Court Justice Anthony
Kennedy is retiring and now for the
second time at his presidency Donald
Trump is poised to exercise one of the

name:Trevor Noah

text:president's most consequential powers
nominating the courts next justice so we
have a to come up we have to pick a
great one we have to pick one that's
gonna be there for 40 years 45 years god
damn this is so crazy

name:Trevor Noah

text:iq realized regardless of what happens
in his presidency now Donald Trump will
leave a mark on this country for decades
to come
yeah it's like it's not gonna go away
it's like he's giving America judicial

name:Trevor Noah

text:herpes you realize his court picks will
be around for so long that they'll be
ruling on major legal questions way into
the future like whether or not Elon Musk
can marry his robot slaves like we
where it's gonna go and I here's the

name:Trevor Noah

text:thing I can handle the idea of Donald
Trump being president for a few years
what blows my mind though is that he
will be able to fundamentally reshape
America for generations Donald Trump is
gonna shape America this guy and I'd

name:Trevor Noah

text:look it right in that fat ugly face of
hers I'd say Rosie you're fired the
power to redefine what America is this
guy Bing Bing bong bong Bing Bing Bing
seriously this guy Trump steaks are by
far the best tasting most flavorful beef

name:Trevor Noah

text:you've ever had out of all the people
that could have been it's this guy I've
said that if he vodka weren't my
daughter perhaps I'd be dating her you
never know with the new Supreme Court's
that sure could be legal you never know

name:Trevor Noah

text:yeah that's what you work for you never
know he's there like that's what I've
been working for folks I've been really
trying baby trying to hold back these
feelings for so long anyway
anyway a Supreme Court judge stepping

name:Trevor Noah

text:aside is never a small thing but this
one could have especially far-reaching
consequences because while Anthony
Kennedy was generally conservative one
of the notable things that he did was
consistently protect roe v-- wade AKA a

name:Trevor Noah

text:woman's rights to choose which makes
this the moments that the anti-abortion
movement has been waiting for a kennedy
departure could also put abortion rights
in doubt he has consistently supported
the basic holding of roe v-- wade a

name:Trevor Noah

text:trump nominee would probably oppose it
where row v Wade is really the Dred
Scott decision of the twentieth century
I think you're gonna see that overturned
we have a chance to take down roe v wade
this is a historic moment in the

name:Trevor Noah

text:pro-life community today that's right
after Justice Kennedy is replaced
there's a good chance that many states
will make abortion illegal and for many
evangelicals that has been the Holy
Grail it's why many Christians have

name:Trevor Noah

text:supported to continue Donald Trump even
though he sins so much that people cost
him out of demons it's like big on Trump
oh oh thank you I felt so gross Oh
oh I mean your own daughter oh wow you
might be really sad that women will be

name:Trevor Noah

text:losing some of their fundamental rights
but the media is licking its lips on
Capitol Hill the battle lines drawn a
huge battle in Washington over replacing
Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy
this will be a battle all summer all

name:Trevor Noah

text:fall it will be one of the most
contentious political battles in decades
okay I'm sorry but like what battle are
we talking about here I understand these
guys are trying to drum up ratings but
it's not true

name:Trevor Noah

text:Republicans control the Senate okay the
Democrats have no power and no way to
stop them from confirming Trump's
Supreme Court pick like the media is
hyping this up like it's a heavyweight
fights but this is more like a fight

name:Trevor Noah

text:between Floyd Mayweather and a baby you
know there's like and in the blue corner
weighing in at 7 pounds and cranky after
missing his nap it's Timmy
[Applause]
the two leaders seemed to have an

name:Trevor Noah

text:instant rapport the minute kim
jeong-hoon made history by becoming the
first North Korean leader to step foot
in the South in a brief diplomatic dance
he invited president moved across the
military demarcation line back into the

name:Trevor Noah

text:north now it may look funny but we just
witnessed a giant moments in history
that's the first time those leaders have
stepped foot in the other ones country
like you know there was a part of Kim
Jong Moon as well they just wanted to be

name:Trevor Noah

text:like now please step into my country got
him if the North Korea talks end up in
Kim actually giving up his nukes
this would be one of the greatest peace
deals we've ever seen broken which is
why believe it or not South Korea's

name:Trevor Noah

text:president says that president Trump
deserves the Nobel Peace Prize because
he says this never would have happened
if Trump hadn't played bad cop you know
like really bad cop like worst cop ever
like like I'll let you borrow my gun for

name:Trevor Noah

text:five dollars cop and Trump winning the
Nobel Peace Prize or any prize is an
idea that mega supporters really love I
remember you know it was very rough
three four months ago
that's worse

name:Trevor Noah

text:no bail you know that has to be the
world's first Nobel Peace Prize chance
like that's how rowdy Trump's crowds
although they'll chump anything they'll
be at a funeral like condolences
condolences condolences always in our

name:Trevor Noah

text:hearts always in our hearts and now look
I understand some people argue that
Trump didn't actually do much but South
Korea's president he doesn't care right
he's happy to share the glory and Trump
agrees with him except for the share pot

name:Trevor Noah

text:I had one of the fake news groups this
morning now they were saying what do you
think President Trump had to do with it
I'll tell you what Mike how about
everything yeah I hope they have a Nobel
Prize for humility too because this guy

name:Trevor Noah

text:he just killed the game
[Music]
[Music]
you
for me I feel like there is a larger
narrative that goes beyond him being on

name:Trevor Noah

text:the Supreme Court for a lifetime and
that is the conversation and the journey
that Trump in particular has started
around this you know because I don't
know if you saw that that rally that he
hosted where he came out and he mocked

name:Trevor Noah

text:dr. Ford I I don't know if you saw the
the little press conference see moments
he gave outside the White House where he
where he talked about men and he said
you know it's a really scary time to be
a man right now really scary time for

name:Trevor Noah

text:men worst time ever to be a man and then
someone else too you know he said you
can be accused of something you didn't
do in your life is over
that's it your life is over and then
they asked him later they said what

name:Trevor Noah

text:about what about women what is it for
them and he was like it's a great women
are doing great and you know what I
realized in in that moment just just
looking at the sentiments and the
message that the Trump was conveying

name:Trevor Noah

text:it's a really powerful thing that I I
think people take for granted and that
is for me personally I find Trump's most
powerful tool is that he knows how to
wield victimhood he knows how to offer
victimhood to people who have the least

name:Trevor Noah

text:claim to it which is a really really
powerful tool because you realize what
he's doing in that moment is he's saying
the real victims of the me to movement
are men they're the real victims someone
can accuse you at any time and your life

name:Trevor Noah

text:is over they're the real victims and you
know if you if you're against Trump
completely or if you see through it you
go like oh that's nothing but I I think
people take for granted how powerful
that message was there are a lot of men

name:Trevor Noah

text:who that message will connect with
because that's a feeling that many men
have as many men who will be afraid to
admit it maybe but there's many men who
do have that feeling with it like yeah I
mean this is me true movement it's it's

name:Trevor Noah

text:gotten out of control you know it at
anytime someone can come out and accuse
me and and always good people I'm like
what do you mean it's gotten out of
control what does that mean you know and
they'll be like well every week it's a a

name:Trevor Noah

text:new famous person has been accused and
it's it's it's out of control like you
we look through it it's maybe maybe 100
and something people that's that's how
many people have have been me too
that's how many people have been held

name:Trevor Noah

text:accountable
a hundred in something that's not like a
life-changing number of men do you not I
mean they make it sound like all men
have been accused all right but 99.9% of
men have not been accused it's just the

name:Trevor Noah

text:the narrative there's been creators
they're like oh these these 100 men
represent all the men and all men should
be afraid of it but 100 men you could
fit a hundred men into a comedy club and
then Louie CK could come and surprise

name:Trevor Noah

text:that's how few that number is like it's
not that many people but they make it
feel like it's a lot of people because
then what they do is they creates an
idea that all men need to band together
to stop this from happening because it

name:Trevor Noah

text:could happen to you right and then men
become the victims and it's such a
powerful tool to use because if you can
convince men that they are the true
victims of the meatsuit movement you get
men to fight against the movement that's

name:Trevor Noah

text:really about holding men who are doing
bad things accountable as opposed to
making all men scapegoats for something
that they're not doing but it's you get
on say is like it's such a this is a
powerful gripping idea that that that

name:Trevor Noah

text:Trump does really well because when you
think about it you go there I know that
people be like but what about I've seen
men who've been falsely accused and I
Gove yeah but how many well let me ask
it to you this way how many men

name:Trevor Noah

text:percentage-wise have been falsely
accused of a sexual assaults and how
many women have actually been sexually
assaulted you know I mean I'm willing to
bet in this room as we sit here now if I
said to the men how many have been

name:Trevor Noah

text:accused of sexual assault
there probably be nobody in this room
who has but if I said to the women in
this room raise your hand if you've been
kept cold or your ass has been grabbed
or guys made a lewd comments at work or

name:Trevor Noah

text:somebody's made you feel unsafe sexually
in some way or you've actually been
sexually assaulted I regret to say that
there would probably be many hands that
would go up in the room but we have now
been told that the ratio is like oh no

name:Trevor Noah

text:it's more men it's a amendment but it's
the truth is it's women women are the
victims in this situation it doesn't
mean you got to be feeling sorry for
women but it's like no but the women are
the victims and that's what we're trying

name:Trevor Noah

text:to fix all right but Trump has managed
to turn it and he's turned it with
everybody he goes the real victims in in
this story is is is not the kids in the
cages it's you it's you who they they're
coming to take your place you know the

name:Trevor Noah

text:real victim isn't that the refugee from
Syria it's you who's gonna get blown up
by a terrorist bomb that's the real
victim in this story I saw the same
thing in South Africa
we had a pot sites at the end of the pod

name:Trevor Noah

text:sites the country was changing and then
you had tons of white people who are
like oh I'm afraid no it's what's gonna
happen to me huh the black people are
gonna eat us
we're in danger they're gonna come for

name:Trevor Noah

text:us oh my god I'm the real victim I'm the
real things like will win wait how did
you go from being the person in power to
becoming the victim overnight and it's a
powerful people that did you there's a
powerful tool that people use repeatedly

name:Trevor Noah

text:like over no it's like it's a it's a
tool that trump wheels he's doing it
with men he's done it with with white
people in America is done with Kavanagh
now the guys heading to the Supreme
Court but he's making it like this poor

name:Trevor Noah

text:man look at him this poor man what's the
worst that could happen to brick Havener
what's the worst thing that could happen
is he'd go back to being a federal judge
on one of the most important courts in
the land that's what he goes down to if

name:Trevor Noah

text:he fails what's the worst thing that
happens to dr. Ford she gets mocked by
the President of the United States for
coming forward with a story about sexual
assault which by the way was the one
thing she said she'd definitely

name:Trevor Noah

text:remembered from that night she said I
remember the boys laughing at me that's
what she said and people go why don't
women come forward because when you do
the President of the United States will
use you as a punchline in front of a

name:Trevor Noah

text:crowd and people always go like yeah but
women have an incentive they're doing it
for the for the fame what are the names
of Cosby's accusers what's the money
what money did they get what fame did
every remedy shows where are these

name:Trevor Noah

text:people do you even know them would you
recognize them in the street what Fame
do they get Ford is gonna come and go
Kavanagh is here forever
and people make it seem like there's
some incentive and that's why I say what

name:Trevor Noah

text:Trump is saying about victimhood is so
powerful because I know that even myself
I have to combat the feeling that I as a
man have because I go what if I get
falsely accused and I go yeah but you've
been tricked you're not gonna get

name:Trevor Noah

text:falsely accused like it it's not
happening as rampantly as people to make
it out to me but if you can convince
people that they are in fact the victims
when they are from a position of power
you have the most powerful tool that you

name:Trevor Noah

text:can wield and the irony is oftentimes
those people who are in those positions
want the people who are genuinely the
closest to victimhood to relinquish
their victimhood to join their team you
know so if you're a woman that

name:Trevor Noah

text:with Trump in the Republicans you're
gonna be like I've had my ass crap and
you know what it doesn't matter
you gotta move past it because I'm not a
victim if you want to be a black person
lower rolling with trunk you got to be

name:Trevor Noah

text:like black people on oppressed that's
right I'm free that's right
I wear manga hat and I release hits I'm
free you gotta you gotta act like it's
not happening and it's a scary powerful
tool that people take for granted people

name:Trevor Noah

text:felt because of Trump like they were
losing their country they felt like
America was losing and feeling is often
times more powerful than what's actually
happening and that's a thing that I
think people take for granted with

name:Trevor Noah

text:Donald Trump for me it's his greatest
gift
she's greatest danger and I like I'm
heartbroken at what happens in dr. Ford
not because it you know didn't go the
way I would have maybe wanted it to but

name:Trevor Noah

text:rather because her life in her image her
as a human being has been trodden on and
destroyed by the President of the United
States as he goes from ready to rally
and people are like yeah it's a partisan
thing you know well you know kudos to

name:Trevor Noah

text:you Trump one of the richest people in
the world and he's like we're losing
folks the game is rigged it's like how
are you losing from your billionaire
your billionaire when you're eight years
old how you losing how are you losing I

name:Trevor Noah

text:just feel it I just feel
[Music]
you
if you work anywhere on the East Coast
during Thanksgiving you would know that
it got so damn cold like it was freezing

name:Trevor Noah

text:it was so cold that your turkey refused
to come out of the oven you're like it's
time ticket was lying about ten more
minutes ten more minutes he'll miss and
because of that some of you might have
been thinking

name:Trevor Noah

text:whatever happened to global warming well
on Friday the US government told us a
new government report says manmade
climate change is already wreaking havoc
on the u.s. 13 federal agencies warns of
more destructive Western wildfires

name:Trevor Noah

text:longer heat waves in the southeast and
more powerful Atlantic hurricanes it
says climate change could shrink the US
economy by hundreds of billions of
dollars by the end of the century I love
how America always thinks about

name:Trevor Noah

text:everything in economic terms forgive me
when they talk about the end of the
world they say climate change is gonna
kill everybody and that's gonna cost us
like a billion dollars but this is big
news 13 agencies all part of the Trump

name:Trevor Noah

text:administration have released an official
report saying that manmade climate
change is not only real but its effects
are already here yeah already here it's
like in the movies when someone screams
close the door we're all gonna die and

name:Trevor Noah

text:then the front turns and they're
bleeding the night we're all ready dad
he's like no you're already dead I'm out
so if the Trump administration said that
manmade climate change is happening then
surely the Trump of the administration

name:Trevor Noah

text:will finally come on board but this is
what the president said when asked what
he thinks of the report I've seen it
I've read some of it and it's fine
yeah I don't believe it no no I don't
believe it

name:Trevor Noah

text:you don't believe it you don't how fine
how how can one man possess all the
stupidity of mankind it's like they
edited his genes to give him superhuman
stupidity like the sciences in the lab
were like whoa she was given superhuman

name:Trevor Noah

text:strength alike oh that's dangerous to
society no no no no that's it make him
really stupid what's the worst that
could happen so the President of the
United States is throwing away four
years of scientific work which is

name:Trevor Noah

text:endorsed by his own administration the
question is what possible reason with
thousands of scientists have to lie
about climate change well former senator
Rick Santorum has a theory which he
shared on CNN this weekend if there was

name:Trevor Noah

text:no climate change we'd have a lot of
scientists looking for work the reality
is that that a lot of these scientists
are driven by the money that they
receive and of course they don't receive
money from corporations and Exxon and

name:Trevor Noah

text:the like why because they're not allowed
to because it's tainted but they can
receive it from people who have who
support their agenda of course how did
we miss it climate changes it's a scam
it's a scam by Sciences trying to get

name:Trevor Noah

text:rich we should have known when we saw
them boiling in those Gucci lab culture
the diamond-encrusted beakers making a
grain test tubes in the club Wow
oh and it wasn't just Rick Santorum
after this report came out all right

name:Trevor Noah

text:American news was littered with climate
change buffoons and one of my favorites
was this woman NBC brought on to drop
this gem we need to also recognize that
we just had two of the coldest years the
biggest drop in global temperatures that

name:Trevor Noah

text:we've had since the 1980s the biggest in
the last hundred years from the
standpoint of those who have doubts
about this and I don't think we can have
any doubts that there is climate change
whether it's anthropogenic I don't know

name:Trevor Noah

text:I'm not a scientist I look at this as a
citizen okay once you say I'm not a
scientist why is anyone listening to
your scientific opinion I look at this
as a citizen will get the fuck out of
here with your opinions of the citizen

name:Trevor Noah

text:like where else would we accept this
shit you tell me now where else would we
accept this if someone told me hey
Trevor these test results say that you
have cancer but I'm not a doctor I think
you're fine trust me I would not be like

name:Trevor Noah

text:oh you're not a doctor no no carry on
carry on yeah tell me your thoughts on
my health and here's the thing I can
play clips from the news like this
forever but why why can i play clips
like this forever why does the news keep

name:Trevor Noah

text:bringing on non-scientists to argue
against science I mean CNN pays Rick
Santorum to come on and talk that shit
this woman's group has gotten funding
from oil companies so why is the news
having these climate deniers on like why

name:Trevor Noah

text:would you do that because think of it
think of it this way when Maury Povich
brings someone on if the DNA test says
you are the father and that's it the
science has spoken
he doesn't go all right we've done the

name:Trevor Noah

text:DNA test but in your opinion levar why
are you not the father because he knows
dudes would be like well first of all
cuz it's expensive and second oh look at
that baby's hair then a my shit so all
I'm saying is American news maybe you

name:Trevor Noah

text:should respect science as much as Maury
Povich does

Manuel McCrone has arrived in America
for the first state visit hosted by
President Trump while other leaders seem
to clash with Trump McCrone was the Bell

name:Trevor Noah

text:to Trump's Beast McCrone has been dubbed
the Trump whisperer by some because of
their close diplomatic relationship
macron says he and Trump have a special
relationship mr. president they're all
saying what a great relationship we have

name:Trevor Noah

text:and they're actually correct it's not
fake news finally it's not fake news
look excited little Donny is man doesn't
doesn't he look like he just invited his
best friend over for a sleepover it's
actually cute yeah they might even play

name:Trevor Noah

text:truth or dare view like okay my turn
dare me to sleep with your wife how
about do we do truth instead okay truth
I want to sleep with your wife but the
ultimate test is how you handle it when
he publicly humiliates you it's a great

name:Trevor Noah

text:honor great under the video but we do
have a very special relationship in fact
I'll get that little piece of dandruff
oh we have to make them perfect he is
perfect so it is really it is really
great to be with you and you are a

name:Trevor Noah

text:special friend thank you thank you
yo yo this dude
this dude just picked something white
off McCrone shoulder and then announced
it to dandruff like he just announced it
has dandruff to the cameras like look

name:Trevor Noah

text:look I found a dandruff I found it and
credits from a Crone he just went with
it yeah that's diplomacy because if I
was McCrone I would have clapped back
he'll be like you got there I would have
been like excuse me I have done rough no

name:Trevor Noah

text:Donald you are a human dandruff you are
the flecks on the scalp of society I
shampoo you from my lab but he was calm
he handled it perfect in fact every
moment McCrone handled perfectly you
know whether it was giving speeches or

name:Trevor Noah

text:playing outside you could really feel
that McCrone was connecting with Trump
and we all know that Trump is not the
sentimental type
but hey anemic rom made him feel a way
that he's never ever felt before

name:Trevor Noah

text:human
[Applause]
[Music]
I like him 11 like I I know it's I don't
say cliche but that's a bromance present
Trump was at the White House hosting

name:Trevor Noah

text:President Buhari of Nigeria although
let's be honest Trump probably thought
he was meeting with African Ray Charles
and things got a little awkward at the
press conference because remember last
year when Trump called African countries

name:Trevor Noah

text:shitholes well that came up did you
address his reported comments from
earlier this year when he reportedly
used vulgar language to describe African
nations I'm not sure about you know the
validity or whether that allegation

name:Trevor Noah

text:against the president was true or not so
the best thing for me is to keep quiet
we didn't discuss it and you do have
some countries that are in very bad
shape and very tough places to live in
as I said shitholes

name:Trevor Noah

text:[Applause]
president Trump remember him we all know
he wants to build a wall and now he
wants other countries to build one too
president Trump has a brand new border
wall controversy only this one involves

name:Trevor Noah

text:a desert in Africa Spain's foreign
minister says Trump told him he should
build a border wall across the entire
Sahara Desert to thwart Europe's migrant
crisis imagine imagine having the world
learn about your toad penis and it's

name:Trevor Noah

text:still only the second most embarrassing
story about you this week and you know
I'd like to be honest I'm disappointed
in Trump because when he first came up
with the wall I thought he was like a
crazy out-of-the-box thinker but now I

name:Trevor Noah

text:realize he's only got one move but I
wouldn't be shocked if Trump uses the
wall as a pickup line like he's that guy
at the bar I was like excuse me miss is
that drink a wall because somebody else
is about to pay for it

name:Trevor Noah

text:and let's just by the way I can't even
believe I have to say this but Africa is
not a part of Spain so they can't just
build something on someone else's land
today President Trump chaired a meeting
of the UN Security Council and the good

name:Trevor Noah

text:news is he now believes that foreign
countries do meddle in u.s. elections
yes the bad news is he only cares if he
thinks it will hurt him
regrettably we found that China has been
attempting to interfere in our upcoming

name:Trevor Noah

text:2018 election they do not want me or us
to win because I am the first president
ever to challenge China on trade and we
are winning on trade we are winning at
every level I love how the one China
delegate in the back rows like is this

name:Trevor Noah

text:thing plugged in properly
I just got say what I think he's saying
because this is genius you realize that
Trump is basically saying that if he
gets crushed in the midterms it's not
because he's bad it's because he's so

name:Trevor Noah

text:good China had to do something about it
yeah and by the way no one knows where
he got this hacking claim from right he
could have gotten it from the CIA or
maybe he just got a fortune cookie he
didn't like you know just like god damn

name:Trevor Noah

text:you China you're hacking me I can't stay
mad at you chai
whoa Donner the president agrees to meet
face to face with North Korea's leaders
something no president has ever done the
decision to meet came suddenly and

name:Trevor Noah

text:dramatically once president Trump heard
that Kim jong-un wanted to meet with him
he quickly agreed the president was
ecstatic poking his head into the White
House briefing room to announce that
something big was about to happen this

name:Trevor Noah

text:is the cutest story I've heard about
Trump in a long time he was so excited
Kim jong-un wanted to meet him that he
was running around the White House
telling everyone it's like did you guys
hear I said yes before now a sitting US

name:Trevor Noah

text:president meeting with the leader of
North Korea is like a Sesame Street
episode about group sex it's never
happened he's not prepared Jonathan
that's the problem there's no one at the
State Department to brief him there's we

name:Trevor Noah

text:have no ambassador to South Korea well
he'd be prepared we don't know but but
Donna you have to admit that the
previous White House and the one before
that had some of the most well-prepared
brilliant foreign policy minds that

name:Trevor Noah

text:we've ever seen and it was failure oh
that's a really good point the experts
have been trying to solve North Korea
for twenty years and it's only gotten
worse so if the smart people can't do it
why not try Trump right it's like it's

name:Trevor Noah

text:like if you had a rare disease that the
world's top doctors couldn't cure so you
were like you know what why not let that
dog in I had give it a try yeah how did
he even get that hatch he's got to be
pretty smart

name:Trevor Noah

text:earlier before their historic sit-down
in Singapore the two leaders sizing each
other up with a handshake yeah you heard
that right
president Trump said meeting Kim jong-un
was his great honour I mean then again

name:Trevor Noah

text:when you've appeared in a McDonald's
commercial talking to grimace everything
seems like an honor I get it I get it
but this alone this alone is what North
Korea has been pining for for decades
all right equals standing with the

name:Trevor Noah

text:American president shaking hands their
Flags side-by-side some may have seen
that I thought Oh
Trump's being nice for now but when he
gets came alone in that negotiation room
he's gonna die nuke his nuts off but it

name:Trevor Noah

text:turns out only one man lost his nuts in
that room Trump and Kim signed a joint
document committing to work towards
quote complete denuclearization of the
Korean Peninsula the agreement is short
on specifics like whether the

name:Trevor Noah

text:denuclearization will be verifiable and
irreversible there's nothing new in this
agreement these are vague assertions
from North Korea a piece of paper that
got signed yesterday is frankly weak I
mean this is this is not a strong piece

name:Trevor Noah

text:of paper because you realize Kim didn't
commit to anything he basically Facebook
RSVP'd a nuclear deal that's all he did
and while Kim gave up nothing major he
got the American President to give up a
lot more president Trump making a

name:Trevor Noah

text:massive concession agreeing to stop
joint military exercises between the
United States and South Korea exercises
that greatly annoyed the North Korean
leader South Korea caught off guard by
the president's announcement responding

name:Trevor Noah

text:that they need to figure out the
accurate meaning and intention behind
the statement good luck with that South
Korea yeah good luck
we've been trying to figure out Trump's
accurate meaning and intention since the

name:Trevor Noah

text:day he stepped off that escalator yeah
this is incredible
Kim jong-un went up against the world's
greatest negotiator the man who
literally hired someone to write the art
of the deal and got him to give up

name:Trevor Noah

text:something for nothing
it's almost like Kim jong-un did a Jedi
mind trick on Trump
you know Trump was like yes I will stop
military exercises and I will also pick
you up from the airport it'll be fun Kim

name:Trevor Noah

text:Jong hoon he owned the summit so hard by
the end he'd even turned the leader of
the free world into his personal hype
man Kim jong-un as you know has killed
family members has starved his own
people why are you so comfortable

name:Trevor Noah

text:calling him very talented well he is
very talented anybody that takes over a
situation like he did at 26 years of age
and is able to run it and run it tough
Kim is a brutal dictator he runs a
police state for starvation labor camps

name:Trevor Noah

text:he's assassinated members of his own
family how do you trust a killer like
that his country does love him his
people you see the fervor they have a
great fervor I think they're gonna end
up with a very strong country and a

name:Trevor Noah

text:country which has people that there's so
hard working so industrious so so you
saw people enslaved in labor camps and
you thought man these people love their
jobs really Donald this is what happens
when you're friends with Kanye West I

name:Trevor Noah

text:mean
and now and now don't get me wrong don't
get me wrong I'm not saying president
Trump shouldn't have negotiated with Kim
jong-un at all
but there's a big gap between being

name:Trevor Noah

text:civil with the person and endorsing the
Freddy Krueger of human rights the only
part of that summit that didn't seem to
go Kim's way is when Donald Trump
slipped up and appeared to make a fat
joke about his new friend

name:Trevor Noah

text:[Music]
[Applause]
look on Kim jong-il's face it's like a
scene out of the office slay you can see
he's thinking make him look thin you
mean I'm not sin why didn't anyone tell

name:Trevor Noah

text:me was it the death camps why don't you
tell me and I guess from Trump's
perspective this is what he got out of
the whole summits yeah when he gets back
to the White House his people are gonna
be like mr. president you sold America

name:Trevor Noah

text:down the river and he but yeah but did
you see that fat joke worth it what
happened here was Trump didn't feel the
need to prepare for a nuclear summit
because he thought his million dollar
listing skills would carry him through

name:Trevor Noah

text:and it turns out if the sales pitch
fails he knows that he can always fall
back on his other skill I think he's I
think honestly I think he's gonna do
these things I may be wrong I mean I may
stand before you in six months and say

name:Trevor Noah

text:hey I was wrong I don't know that I'll
ever admit that but I'll find us I'll
find some kind of an excuse truth from
my favorite Trump he basically just
admitted that this whole deal is as
shaky as one of his casinos only if this

name:Trevor Noah

text:thing falls apart instead of bankruptcy
there's a nuclear war after Syrian
President Bashar al-assad attacked his
own people with chemical weapons last
week the world has been waiting to see
if President Trump would respond with

name:Trevor Noah

text:military action and because this is a
decision that could lead to an all-out
war the president announced his decision
with all the gravitas it demanded
president Trump is up and firing off
tweets about the situation in Syria

name:Trevor Noah

text:Russia vows to shoot down any and all
missiles fired at Syria get ready Russia
because they will be coming nice and new
and smart it's hard to see how this is
anything but the president of the United
States declaring war on Twitter I feel

name:Trevor Noah

text:like we joked about this and now it's
become real cuz when Trump got elected
we were like he's gonna start a war on
Twitter ha and then before he got
elected we were like he's gonna become
president

name:Trevor Noah

text:yeah it turns out every joke about Trump
is just a headline that hasn't happened
yet
and also why does Trump tweet so weird
these missiles are nice and new and
smart it sounds like he's trying to fix

name:Trevor Noah

text:them up with the missiles so he sings
with Russians look I know you don't like
blind dates but these missiles they're
really nice really smart
just come no pressure it's just a lunch
come on

name:Trevor Noah

text:so late last night Trump reacted by
grabbing his tweet box and creating a
problem for all of us breaking news is
overnight the president threatening war
with Iran language that raises new
concerns President Trump fired off this

name:Trevor Noah

text:threat to Iranian president rouhani
never ever threaten the United States
again or you will suffer consequences
the likes of which few throughout
history have ever suffered before he was
in all caps which means he was yelling

name:Trevor Noah

text:back at Iran
[Applause]
funny why is the explaining capslock to
Fox viewers they oh they're not Amish
like he's like now there's also a yellow
face with a smile on it it's not a real

name:Trevor Noah

text:person that's a but yes
president Trump has made an all caps
threat to destroy another country and
remember this is the same way he
threatened fire and fury on North Korea
yeah and then six months later totally

name:Trevor Noah

text:caved to Kim jong-un
yeah so there's a good chance that in a
few months we'll see Trump saluting Iran
and America will be under Sharia law
yeah he'll be like I gave it run
everything they wanted folks and now

name:Trevor Noah

text:there will be peace inshallah
[Applause]
[Music]
we all know we all know that in America
many people dislike Donald Trump but it
turns out in England they also don't

name:Trevor Noah

text:like him mr. Trump ban the first lady
also visited Windsor Castle for his
first meeting with Queen Elizabeth which
had some awkward moments as the visit
was taking place tens of thousands of
protesters took to the streets of London

name:Trevor Noah

text:carrying signs with messages like Trump
not welcomed and dumped Trump the
streets of London swelled with tens of
thousands of people protesting President
Trump
including an inflatable Trump baby blimp

name:Trevor Noah

text:and if the British dislike Trump before
he arrived his visits only made things
worse the president breached British
protocol by publicly disclosing the
details of a conversation he had with
Queen Elizabeth it broke royal protocol

name:Trevor Noah

text:by walking in front of the Queen but she
quickly stepped forward to correct the
error
he also today had tea with the Queen he
did keep her waiting for 10 minutes
video recorded the very punctual 92 year

name:Trevor Noah

text:old Queen checking her watch prior to
the president's arrival good lord
is there is there any rule he didn't
break was like President Trump in hot
water after pushing the Queen into the
Royal swimming pool

name:Trevor Noah

text:for more on trumps UK visit we're joined
by an actual British person Gina Yashiro
everybody
in the US Trump's UK visit seemed to not
go so well but as a British person what
do you think it was an unmitigated

name:Trevor Noah

text:disaster Trevor this womble yeah
let's not call him he came came to our
country and insulted us I mean look what
he did to our queen he's cutting her off
like he's trying to beat her to the
early bird special but it wasn't just

name:Trevor Noah

text:the protocol that he messed up Trump was
straight rude he insulted our Prime
Minister on tape before we even met with
that and then he blamed the Mayor of
London Sadiq Khan for terrorism
obviously because he's Muslim and it

name:Trevor Noah

text:must have been one of his cousin's Wow
you know after this I bet you wish that
Trump had never come at all are you
kidding

often but Regina you just said that

that photo of President Trump at the g7
summit from a few weeks ago I remember

name:Trevor Noah

text:that one we'd look like all the other
world leaders were fighting with Trump
because he refused to take a bath yeah
well it turns out there's a pretty sweet
story behind its Chancellor Merkel of
Germany and Prime Minister Trudeau of

name:Trevor Noah

text:Canada wanted to press Trump directly to
sign the communicate and Trump was
sitting there with his arms crossed
clearly not liking the fact that he felt
like they were ganging up on him he said
okay he'll sign it and at that point he

name:Trevor Noah

text:stood up he put his hand in his pocket
and he took two starbursts candies out
threw them on the table and said to
Merkel here Angola don't say I never
give you anything
I cannot believe that Donald Trump would

name:Trevor Noah

text:have to uneaten starburst in his I also
can't believe he threw them at another
world leader although knowing Trump he
probably immediately snatched the second
starburst back he was like only meant to
give you one

name:Trevor Noah

don't realize this Jacob Zuma was making

name:Trevor Noah

more interesting to me is the fact that

name:Trevor Noah

I would you like some tea with your crop
hats I smash smash smash smash smash my

name:Trevor Noah

text:marshmallow Jacob's if I is laughing it
that's just beautiful I don't know how
much of it is true or not what I do know
is if Jacob Zuma was allowing the Guptas
to control our country and choose our
ministers then it wasn't my president

name:Trevor Noah

text:being corrupt to me it was the goodest
telling him what to do it's like Julius
said the Guptas were in his ear all our
law they were inside his here all along
and you know the way Julius savatthi it
sounded amazing because like I get the

name:Trevor Noah

text:phrase when they go they were in his ear
but he said they were inside his year it
sounded like the cook times were
actually inside Jacob Zuma's ear which
actually would have made sense when you
think about it what if they were inside

name:Trevor Noah

text:his ear the entire time how do we know
that every single time Jacob Zuma was
speaking to us as a nation he was
actually telling us what the Guptas were
saying to him like he had one of those
earpieces that they have on those

name:Trevor Noah

text:hidden-camera shows yeah like he was
there in Parliament outside Parliament
there was a van with the Guptas sitting
inside it

to while also speaking we understand
Jacob but do you know we've already made
a plan do you and us so repeat

name:Trevor Noah

text:everything that I say okay okay I will
repeat everything and that's probably
why things went wrong because I don't
know if you've ever tried to listen to
someone while talking to someone else
your mind jams yeah that's why Jacob

name:Trevor Noah

text:Zuma could never deliver a speech it's
not that he couldn't read he couldn't
listen he couldn't listen and speak at
the same time I used to watch him and be
like what's going on Jacob King car yo

A FEW WEEKS AGO I WENT TO THE
WHITE HOUSE FOR A PARTY.
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I'VE BEEN
THERE IN MANY YEARS.
AND IT WAS VERY EXCITING.
AND B.E.T. SPONSORED THE PARTY.
SO EVERYONE THERE WAS BLACK.

name:Kevin Hart

text:AND IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.
I WALKED THROUGH THE GATES.
I'M FROM WASHINGTON, SO I SAW
THE BUS STOP, THE CORNER WHERE
THE BUS STOP USED TO BE.
WHERE I USED TO CATCH THE BUS TO
SCHOOL AND DREAM ABOUT NIGHTS
LIKE TONIGHT.
IT WAS A REALLY, REALLY
BEAUTIFUL NIGHT.
AT THE END OF THE NIGHT EVERYONE
WENT INTO THE WEST WING OF THE

text:WHITE HOUSE AND IT WAS A HUGE
PARTY.
AND EVERYBODY IN THERE WAS
BLACK.
EXCEPT FOR BRADLEY COOPER, FOR
SOME REASON.
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND ON THE WALLS WERE PICTURES
OF ALL THE PRESIDENTS.
OF THE PAST.
NOW, I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS
TRUE, BUT TO MY KNOWLEDGE THE

text:FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT THAT WAS
OFFICIALLY INVITED TO THE WHITE
HOUSE WAS FREDERICK DOUGLASS.
THEY STOPPED HIM AT THE GATES.
ABRAHAM LINCOLN HAD TO WALK OUT
HIMSELF AND ESCORT FREDERICK
DOUGLASS INTO THE WHITE HOUSE.
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN AS FAR AS
I KNOW UNTIL ROOSEVELT WAS
PRESIDENT.
ROOSEVELT WAS PRESIDENT, HE HAD
A BLACK GUY OVER.

name:Kevin Hart

MEDIA THAT HE LITERALLY SAID, I
WILL NEVER HAVE A N -- IN THIS
HOUSE AGAIN.
I THOUGH ABOUT THAT, LOOKED AT
THAT BLACK ROOM, SAY ALL THOSE
BLACK FACES AND BRADLEY.

AND I SAW HOW HAPPY EVERYBODY
WAS.

text:Hi, I'm Samantha Bee. Welcome to Full
Frontal
Well, here we are. Now, after a massacre,
the standard operating procedure is that
you stand on stage and deliver some
well-meaning words about how we will get
through this together,
how love wins, how love conquers hate,
and that is great.
That is beautiful. But you know what, fuck
it

name:Samantha bee

text:I am too angry for that. Love does not
win unless we start loving each other
enough to fix our fuckin problems.
There were three hundred and seventy instances in 2015
where more than four people were shot at
one given time, more than one per day
hey, is it okay if instead of making
jokes, I just scream for seven minutes
until we go to commercial?

name:Samantha bee

text:No, it's not okay? Okay, here we go. Mass
shootings have become so frequent in
this country it seems like the only
thing that will stop a bad guy with a
gun is another bad guy with a gun who
coincidentally came to shoot up the same
place. Our mass shooter du jour was Omar Mateen, born in New York.
He beat his ex-wife, he'd been reported
multiple times to his employer as
homophobic and unhinged, and the FBI had
twice questioned him for ties to

name:Samantha bee

text:terrorism. But none of these things
disqualified him from legally buying a
gun that shoots 45 rounds a minute.
Not even his terrible mirror selfies.
I think we can all agree that if you
don't have one friend to hold the phone
for you,
your lone wolf ass doesn't get a gun.

name:Samantha bee

text:Let this be a lesson, ladies. If someone's
tinder profile is just mirror selfies,
they're definitely a murderer. But you
know what hey who could have predicted
that letting suspected extremists buy
guns was a bad idea? Other than Obama,
less than two weeks ago.
I've got
people who we know have been on
ISIL websites, living here in the United

name:Samantha bee

text:States, US citizens, and we're allowed to
put them on the no fly list when it
comes to airlines, but because of the
National Rifle Association,
I cannot prohibit those people from
buying a gun.
Obama may have been explaining that
vulnerability in our gun laws at the
very moment the Orlando shooter was
taking advantage of it.
Did the shooter just watch PBS News Hour and go, "hey, that's what I should do"?

name:Samantha bee

text:You know what, of course
this raises some very thorny questions --
should we restrict people's rights based
on scary things they say? Are innocent
lives worth less than the sanctity of
free speech?
Even if it's hate speech? And what about
profiling? You know what, these questions
are hard

name:Samantha bee

text:it's a lot easier to just accept that
going to a public place carries a non
zero risk of dying in a hail of bullets.
This could happen anywhere in the world, unfortunately today was Orlando's turn.
Orlando's turn. Mass shootings are so
normalized now that we're taking turns
Hey Minnesota, this is Delaware. It's my
turn for a mass shooting tomorrow, but I

name:Samantha bee

text:have family visiting, so can you switch
mass shootings with me? Thanks bye.
and as for anywhere in the world: not
quite, Sparky. Australia had five mass
shootings between 1987-1996. Then the
public decided that was no fun.
Parliament passed strict gun laws and
they haven't had a mass shooting since
then.
Let me repeat that, Australia hasn't had
a single mass shooting since the Fresh

name:Samantha bee

text:Prince left Bel Air and was never heard
from again.
Of course, you know, Australia doesn't have a second
amendment. Love you Madison, and
congratulations on your Tony, but you
really fucked us with that one.
We can't constitutionally get rid of all
guns but can't we get semi-automatic
assault rifles out of the hands of
civilians?
Sam Bee wants to take your guns away! Yes! The ones that

name:Samantha bee

text:mow down a roomful of people in seconds,
yes I do want to take those guns away.
These high capacity penis substitutes
are a shitty choice for hunting and home
protection, but perfect for portable
mayhem.
That's right, what Paul Giamatti is to
biopics, the highly profitable AR-15 is
to deadly mass shootings. It turns up at gay nightclubs, movie theaters, and
elementary school colleges, even an
office party with coworkers

name:Samantha bee

text:it's nicknamed America's gun and unlike
handguns it can be bought in florida
with no waiting period. Perhaps the
governor would like to comment on that?
Look,
we're dealing with a tragedy right now,
our prayers go out to everybody impacted
law enforcement's doing their job.
If only shooting victims could dodge

name:Samantha bee

text:bullets as deftly as you dodge that
question
there will be plenty of time to think
about how do we make, you know, continue
to improve our society
What the fuck are you even talking about? This wasn't even Orlando's first high-profile
gun murder of the weekend.
stop thinking and do something to
improve our society

name:Samantha bee

text:we're going to continue to work on how
we do that. We're a resilient state. Bye bye.
what what
okay bye-bye, later skater, don't let the
door hit you where the good Lord split
ya
seriously, that guy bolted so fast I'm
surprised every wall in the Florida
State House doesn't have a Rick Scott
shaped hole in it. But the governor

name:Samantha bee

text:didn't get too far before CNN managed to
get him on the phone
(TAPPER) There are a lot of Americans watching
right now who want to know what they can
do to help.
What can they do to help, sir?
--(SCOTT) I think the biggest thing is pray. Pray for the victims,
pray for their families,
pray that it never happens again

name:Samantha bee

text:You heard the man. The biggest, most
helpful thing you can do to ensure this
never happens again is sit quietly in a
room with your eyes closed, talking to
nobody
Wait a minute, we pray after every mass
shooting and yet they keep happening.
Maybe we're not praying right. Can we
check the instruction manual?
thus also faith by itself, if it does not
have works, is dead

name:Samantha bee

text:Oh, shit.
We were supposed to do something while we prayed? To be fair,
Rick Scott did sign a law restricting
personal backyard shooting ranges in
crowded residential neighborhoods, which
is apparently something you have to tell
Floridians not to do.
But he spent most of his administration
relaxing Florida's gun laws until

name:Samantha bee

text:they're looser than the twat of an
elephant who just had triplets.
I don't know if that's because Scott's
head is essentially a semi jacketed 200
9-millimeter round, and I don't care
because we were reminded yesterday,
controlling lethal weapons through a
patchwork of state laws is pretty
useless as long as America still
contains roads and Indiana.
There is no shortage of troubled 20
something's out there and whether

name:Samantha bee

text:they're radicalized by ISIS or
homophobia or white nationalism or a
dislike of movies, we are making it far
too easy for their derangement to kill
us.
So until we as a nation find the
political will to reject a mass shooting
per day as the price of freedom,
I'm just gonna pray. Are you there, god?
It's me, Sam. Please bless the victims and

name:Samantha bee

text:their friends and families in their time
of unspeakable pain.
Give us the courage to say no more.And
while you're at it, please send the NRA a
plague of boils.
Amen. We'll be right back.

back in 2010 by a dear dear friend of

looking at the puppets themselves you
have to see who's behind the puppets who
is choosing the puppets and the players
who's the puppet master George Soros who

interest in me once they've seen my
massive puppet collection
sleepy old Zadie is not a puppet master
he may be wealthy and influential but he
does not control the government the

text:weather or anyone's poops aside I hope
from his own but the idea of Jews as
wealthy scheming world dominators goes
way back farther than 2010 it's as old
as Mike Pence thinks the earth is for
example everything people say about

text:Soros was said before about Nathan Mayer
Rothschild of the long demonized
Rothschild banking family nathan was
falsely accused of profiteering from
napoleon's bloody defeat at Waterloo an
utterly false smear that stuck to all

as we all know the only people to have
ever made bazillions off the Battle of
Waterloo are Abba so it went through the
years the stars of Russia the Nazis
Richard Nixon all of them found Soros

consolidate their power and justify
their behavior anti-semitism isn't
unique to the right but right now it is
shockingly mainstream in the Republican

off do you believe George Soros is
behind all of this paying these people
to get you and your colleagues in
elevators or wherever they can get in
your face I have heard so many people

call globalists they like they like the
globe I like the globe - I like the

people we have to globalist I can't help
think that the Democrats perhaps Soros

the background George Soros is one of
those people that actually helps me you
know back these individuals do you think
George Soros funded the neo-nazis who
marched in wouldn't it be interesting to

you look at Nazis and go hmm seems
Jewish unless you're thinking
hey maybe this is the harmless kind of
ethnic hatred remember a radicalized
Trump supporter sent George Soros a bomb

name:Samantha bee

text:last week when someone spouts this
bullshit it's not an accident
but it's especially not an accident if
in addition to the dog whistles you have
deep foghorns of hate during the
campaign Donald Trump posted an

name:Samantha bee

text:anti-semitic meme of a Star of David
next to Hillary Clinton and later Sean
Spicer did whatever this was someone is
despicable as Hitler who didn't even
sink to the to the - using chemical
weapons those comments sparking an

name:Samantha bee

text:immediate backlash Hitler gassed
millions of Jews in concentration camps
during the Holocaust that forcing Spicer
to clarify before the briefing was over
I think when you come to sarin gas
there was no he was not using the gas on

is doing there was not in the in the he
brought him into the - to the Holocaust
center and I understand that Spicer
apparently referring to concentration
camps when he used the term Holocaust

Sean Spicer is just out in the world
right now eating mayonnaise with a spoon
by the way I know Trump has a daughter
who's Jewish I forget her name she's
never really come up on the show but he

name:Samantha bee

text:can't be anti-semitic his daughter is
also a woman and he sure hates those
scapegoating Jewish people is an ancient
horrible tradition and it is happening
in our country Republicans didn't ask
their supporters to take an ar-15 and

were speaking a language that shooter
heard loud and clear he posted
conspiracy theories about Soros on
social media just like politicians soup
bosses and even the president have the

surged since Trump's election and they
are not coming out of nowhere
Trump has whipped up a xenophobic mop

you
welcome back to the show one of the
major questions being debated in our
country today is whether it's okay for
the president to lie his fucking face

name:Samantha bee

text:off 24 hours a day
somehow the jury is still out on that
what do you do when he says something
like millions of voters voted illegally
in California when you know that that's
not true well I don't know if that's not

name:Samantha bee

text:sure John there is no evidence when
you're president can you just offer a
theory that has no evidence behind it or
does he have to tighten up his standards
of proof I think he's done a great job
you did okay

name:Samantha bee

text:guess that answers my next question is
it okay for the White House chief of
staff to lie his fucking face off I'll
put you down for a yes how could anyone
believe three million undocumented
Californians would get up early and risk

name:Samantha bee

text:arrest and deportation to perform an
onerous task we can't even get our own
citizens to do okay point taken
for the record massive voter fraud
is a lie but this lie didn't spring
athina like from Donald's collapsing

name:Samantha bee

text:pumpkin of a head he is a marketer his
big lies are like his buildings he
doesn't build them he just slaps his
brand on them and tricks the press into
promoting them for free I'm sure they'll
stop taking the bait any day now where

name:Samantha bee

text:does that three million number come from
two places one a study which was widely
rebutted even by the managers of the
opt-in web survey it's based on and
whose authors said Trump had misread
their results as proof of massive voter

wish I had a better name though how
about pokemons go to the polls that's
great lose the youth vote but Greg

don't want everybody to vote elections
are not won by a majority of people they
never have been from the beginning of
our country and they are not now as a
matter of fact our leverage in the

text:elections quite candidly goes up as the
voting populous goes down by those
standards I guess the best American
election yet was the one in 2000 look I
get it that's just politics Republicans
win if they keep people from voting

name:Samantha bee

text:especially Democrat people but how do
you look at a group of voters and pick
out the Democrat if only there was some
way to tell them apart
there are right now 20-plus states in
implementing voter restrictions to try

name:Samantha bee

text:to take to reduce the number of people
who can vote which we know will have a
disproportionate impact on poor and
minority communities including black
people we kind of Bhama by 5% which was
big he beat McCain by 10% he beat Romney

name:Samantha bee

text:by 5% I think that probably photo ID had
helped a bit in that you can't say what
voter ID is really for if you want to
sell something slightly shameful you
need to package it as a cure for
something else and that is how

name:Samantha bee

text:Republicans discovered a national
epidemic of neck pain aka voter fraud
stealing your vote alarming reports of
voter fraud are running rampant right
now drug money even said to be involved
and the reality is voter fraud is

name:Samantha bee

text:rampant across this country I don't
think there's rotor fraud I know there
was water problems you're talking about
probably over a million people that
voted twice in this election the first
concrete evidence we've ever had of

name:Samantha bee

text:massive voter fraud two questions one
did you have your makeup done at the
American Girl doll store and two how do
you find concrete evidence of a thing
Republicans made up electoral officials
in 27 states have launched a massive new

name:Samantha bee

text:campaign against voter fraud they are
using a computer name matching system to
claim that more than three million
citizens may be registered to vote in
more than one state now the lists are
based on common names like John Jackson

name:Samantha bee

text:or David Lee what under that system the
only people safe from voter purging are
Whoopi Goldberg and Yahoo serious
if Trump manages to smash America's
institutions it will only be because GOP
termites have been gnawing away at the

name:Samantha bee

text:foundation for years with baseless
claims of election shenanigans remember
all the party wanted was an excuse to
pass voter restrictions but once you put
a lie out there it grows and takes on a
life of its own you want to know what

name:Samantha bee

text:your little fib did behold
voting is a privilege in this country
and you need to be legal not like
California where three million illegals
voted so where are you getting your
information from the media where our

name:Samantha bee

text:media some of the bush CNN I believe in
answer the three million illegal people
voted media maybe I've heard it here
maybe here it was on a screen and it
activated my endorphin so it must be
true now if you'll just excuse me I'll

name:Samantha bee

text:just forward it to all my nieces and
nephews I mean unless someone I trust
tells me it's bullshit Trump tweeted in
the last week or so that he had actually
won the popular vote if you deduct the
millions who voted illegally do you

to common sense it turns out we cannot

in this revolving door that's right and
it's not one of those fun revolving
doors like you see in YouTube video
arresting people with mental illness
means that Florida spends nearly a

not on treating people but on teaching
them about the legal system so they can

Florida if you were standing your ground
it's neither but at least jail is
cheaper than giving ill people the
treatment they need it's a very very

who have mental illness in a
correctional setting it's far less
costly to intervene at the front end and
link people with treatment this is no
different than than providing a humane

Twitter egg of newspapers, cheered our

text:mutual populist rebellion against the
globalization that allowed an Australian

America shouldn't be complacent

So is immigration. Been there, done that,
got the squalid tenement. With the notable
exception of 1066, Britain didn't really

the second half of the 20th century when
Spaniards started washing up on England's

For British bigots, the Brexit vote was like

of Brexit -- not the breakup of the EU or
the fact that you can now use the

morons think that over half the country

It's like if the country music awards

And you know the other thing that
America has that Britain lacks? A butt
ton of evangelical Christians
Thank God. Yeah, you heard that right
America's largest Protestant
denomination has wrapped up its annual
gathering in St. Louis. Members passed
resolutions that encourage Southern

homes and churches
that's potentially 15 million Christians
telling Trump, go tinkle up a border wall.
And it's not new. For years, evangelical
churches have been embracing refugees,
defying political calls to block them,
and even standing up to Islamophobia.

I would like to know how in the world

Rights for Muslims to construct mosques
in the United States when these people
threaten our very way of existence as
Christians and Americans.
sometimes we have really hard decisions
to make, this isn't one of those things
what it means to be a Baptist is to
support soul freedom for everybody
Now that is the shining city on a hill.
Not

name:Samantha bee

text:only does that Southern Baptist
leader defend soul freedom,
he's also a regular on the dance line
so take heart. I mean, we can still wreck
everything if we forget to vote --
it wouldn't be the first time --  but
Trump's brand of right wing, racist,
anti-immigrant demagoguery isn't
American. It's a European import. And if
we're smart we'll stop it at the border
and send it back where it came from

there are several exciting women running

having this many women in the field
means that the defining characteristic

woman now that there are so many ladies
running maybe we can stop talking about

name:Samantha bee

outfits or their marriages and instead
judge them based on their experience I'm
just joking no no no it's gonna be a

after kirsten gillibrand announced her

her press conference pretty likeable a
nice person is now how much is a selling
point
garrison I'll take this one fuck off
your first question you've had two years

name:Samantha bee

Politico is also very concerned about
Elizabeth Warren's likability just hours
after she announced her campaign
Politico asked how does Warren avoid a
Clinton Redux written off as too

name:Samantha bee

text:unlikable before her campaign gets off
the ground here's one way by not writing
a whole fucking article about a
candidate's likability before her
campaign gets off the ground how do I
avoid cheating on my husband well you

name:Samantha bee

text:have a stranger's dick in each one of

Politico would play dumb when they were
constantly peddling sexist takes about
Hillary or should I say the grandma and

the media this is up to you bitch but
Tucker Carson thinks we're overreacting
to the likability question this is
baffling to me and I say this is someone
who's been called unlikable countless

name:Samantha bee

text:times over 20 years it doesn't seem like
a sex specific criticism again I'm
saying this is an unlikable person yes
you are but don't sell yourself short
you're also a white supremacist you are
definitely not sexist love to point out

name:Samantha bee

leaving out men
right so Mitt Romney Al Gore John Kerry
also unlikable there have been a number

have been called unlikable you know John

name:Samantha bee

point John Edwards cheated on his cancer
stricken wife then spent donor money to
keep his pregnant mistress a secret
Elizabeth Warren decided to run for
president yeah of course

name:Samantha bee

text:there's more to being a woman candidate
than likability in the words of every
mean girl ever you also have to stop
trying so hard what is a little Lauren
even doing drinking mirror Elizabeth
Warren with the the beer thing trying to

name:Samantha bee

text:make him look more likeable again I
think at the end of the day what's she
more likable when you saw that no
because it was incredibly awkward and
was clear that she probably doesn't
drink beer a whole lot oh you like beer

text:name ten of their albums
Fox News will be the judge of a true
authentic political moment there's only
ever been one you know they're trying to
do Michael they're trying to relive a
real moment and Bill Clinton playing the

text:saxophone in Arsenio did work it was
real he plays the saxophone you play
with the band people thought that was
great I think there's some kind of
likability factor that people are going
for there and remember when Bill Clinton

name:Samantha bee

text:went on and play the saxophone I think
she's trying to hope to be more good
stuff Bill Clinton was really really
played the saxophone he is Priya a cool
guy that's real absolutely if there's
one thing we remember about Bill Clinton

the Muller probe that is responsible for
the decline in US relations with Russia
do you hold Russia at all accountable
for anything in particular
yes I do I hold both countries

confidence in my intelligence people but
I will tell you that President Putin was
extremely strong and powerful in his
denial today I guess we'll never know

agencies and his Department of Justice
or the guy who smiles like he can only

as an American citizen and as a believer

think how many phone books is Putin

you want the world to think that you're

Putin there was not one part of that
grumbling display the Trump hasn't said
before I believe that President Putin
really feels and he feels strongly that
he did not meddle in our election asked

name:Samantha bee

text:about Russian interference
I don't believe they interfered why not
get along with Russia the president told
reporters quote every time Putin sees me
he says I didn't do that and I believe I
really believe that when he tells me

name:Samantha bee

Putin even sent me a present beautiful
present with a beautiful note
unfortunately he couldn't read the note
but it was beautiful past actually can't
read hashtag Putin his tiny no the most

name:Samantha bee

text:shocking thing on TV this week was a
trump and Putin's standing on a platform
and roasting the United States like a
geopolitical Statler on waldorf know
what shots me was the fact that
Republicans seemed shocked the

name:Samantha bee

text:statements from Republicans today coming
in one after the other John McCain
starting it one of the most disgraceful
performances by an American president in
history Republican senator Ben Sasse
releasing a statement saying quote this

name:Samantha bee

text:is bizarre and flat-out wrong Newt
Gingrich called the president's
performance quote the most serious
mistake of his presidency Senate
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell today
saying in a statement quote Russia is

of course Mitch McConnell's only friend
is the insurance lobbyist who lives in

he really was just doing his greatest

Trump has said it all before it's so

compromised relationship with Russia
back in 2016 Republican leaders were
talking about the DNC hack last summer
when Kevin McCarthy said there's two
people I think that Putin pays

text:Rohrbacher and Trump after some laughter
in the room
MacArthur added swear to God now House
Speaker Paul Ryan responded as the
laughter continued this is an
off-the-record no leaks all right and

name:Samantha bee

text:then he added this is how we know we're
a real family here well to be fair I
think it's less of a family and more of
a clan to run US elections like Mitch
McConnell claimed yesterday I think the
Russians need to know that there are a

name:Samantha bee

text:lot of us who fully understand what
happened in 2016 and it really better
not happen again in 2018 Mitch McConnell
telling Russia they better not mess with
our elections again is about as
effective as telling gravity to stop

name:Samantha bee

text:eating Mitch McConnell's chin and I know
that that chin jokes but the other joke
was about his first chin there are
things they could do to protect the
Republic from the bronzer stain Trump is
leaving on it Republicans could make

name:Samantha bee

text:sure that our next elections aren't
vulnerable to Russian hacks which
approximately no one is doing they could
also pass a bill to protect the mulher
investigation you know like the one
Mitch McConnell killed in the Senate and

name:Samantha bee

text:Paul Ryan said wasn't necessary
Republican leaders are every bit as
compromised by Russia as drunk actually
they're worse
McConnell and Ryan have so far put up
with whatever Putin wants and as far as

name:Samantha bee

text:we know they haven't been peed on by
anyone and
the crazy thing is Russia is beating us
this family what they shouldn't be than
even in the game as a country Russia may
look big but as an actual economics

name:Samantha bee

text:right not so much and not just because
their leader isn't tall enough to write
an American rollercoaster there only our

came as a surprise but guys what's your

welcome to full frontal I am Samantha

but apparently not so for a royal the
Dutchess of Sussex who there it was shut
her own car door oh there it was again
can you imagine that being the breaking
news in your country meanwhile over here

name:Samantha bee

text:it's how many sexual abusers is too many
for a Supreme Court oh I hope you got a
drop of joy from that because this week
has been a shit tornado of terrible news
I've been doing a lot of carrying to get
through it oh you don't know what

name:Samantha bee

text:carrying is it's the latest thing let me
show you the president is on offense
attacking Democrats and mocking one of
Brett Kavanaugh s accusers president
Trump initially showed restraint but not
anymore the president unleashing on

name:Samantha bee

text:Cavanaugh's latest accuser she was
totally inebriated was all messed up and
she doesn't know is him but it might
have been him oh gee let's not make him
a Supreme Court judge because this is a
con game being played by the Democrats

name:Samantha bee

text:time
[Applause]
that's carrying try it it's better than
yoga you know watching the
sexual-assault sir in chief do some
classic victim-blaming is just one of

name:Samantha bee

text:the reasons I've been setting fires with
my mind this week but all the fires are
inspired by Supreme Court nominee and
man who definitely wears a popped collar
under his robes Brett Kavanaugh and the
White House has released Cavanaugh's

name:Samantha bee

text:prepared testimony for that hearing in
it he talks about in high school years
quote I was not perfect in those days
just as I am not perfect today
I drank beer with my friends usually on
weekends sometimes I had too many in

name:Samantha bee

text:retrospect I said and did things in high
school that make me cringe now still he
denied any and all sexual misconduct
when it comes to allegations of sexual
assault it's like what I say about rat
tails one is too many and absolutely

name:Samantha bee

text:disqualifies you from the Supreme Court
it's not just one just today a new
accuser came forward with absolutely
horrific allegations a third woman a
third is now coming forward making
explosive graphic allegations she says

name:Samantha bee

text:that she observed Brett Kavanaugh drink
excessively that he engaged in abusive
and physically aggressive behavior
towards girls including pressing girls
against him without their consent
grinding against girls and attempting to

name:Samantha bee

text:remove or shift girls clothing to expose
private body parts she also she says
witnessed efforts by Mark judge and
Brett Kavanaugh and others to cause
girls to become integrated and
disoriented so that they could be

name:Samantha bee

text:gang-raped you know the next time our
reporter asks me if the jokes just write
themselves during the Trump era show
them that clip and then show them this
picture of my writers guys for rape
jokes please guys of course when the GOP

name:Samantha bee

text:heard the latest
accusation they immediately withdrew
Cavanaugh's nomination they fired up the
old slut-shaming machine you don't go to
ten parties if you see what she's
claiming you go to the cops

name:Samantha bee

text:I think normal people would feel an
obligation to do something about it
I don't know trick why did your friends
at Fox keep showing up at work while
roger ailes was hamburger dicking
everyone with allegations against

name:Samantha bee

text:Cavanaugh this weekend one of
Cavanaugh's classmates at Yale
Ramirez telling The New Yorker when both
she and Cavanaugh were freshmen
Cavanaugh exposed himself to her she
says she remembers Cavanaugh next to her

name:Samantha bee

text:pulling up his pants Brett was laughing
I can still see his face
Ramirez adds somebody yelled down the
hall Brett Kavanaugh just put his penis
in Debbie's face how was this lady's
story not enough even if she'd been the

name:Samantha bee

text:only accuser we should want a Supreme
Court justice who definitely never
shoved his penis in someone's face we
should also want one who doesn't have
baby corn for teeth but that's a
separate thing we as a nation can do

name:Samantha bee

text:better
ramirez's account is very disturbing
which is probably why this little detail
didn't get the attention it deserved
senior Republican staffers learned of
the allegation last week

name:Samantha bee

text:soon after Senate Republicans issued
calls to accelerate the timing of the
vote instead of investigating why would
Republicans try to rush his nomination
through faster when they found out about
more allegations

name:Samantha bee

text:that's like realizing you have diarrhea
and rushing away from the bathroom
not really the right analogy I just
really hope Mitch McConnell has diarrhea
today the most rage-inducing part of
this week was Kavanagh himself who sat

name:Samantha bee

text:down for a soft little triggering his
fuck interview on Fox News Monday night
was there ever a time that you drank so
much that you couldn't remember what
happened the night before no that never
happened I was focused on trying to be

went to an all-boys Catholic High School
a Jesuit High School where I was focused

working on my service projects and
friendship friendship with my fellow

from the local all-girls Catholic
schools okay bitch please don't try to

text:act like you went to high school in an
episode of VeggieTales when your own
yearbook says you were a member of
something called 100 kegs or bust club
somehow I think that was a hundred kegs
of platonic friendship but Cavanaugh

name:Samantha bee

text:continues to maintain that he was the
one teenage boy who was never cruel to
women and hey he's got a list of 65
women to prove it well actually at least
one of them is definitely not a
supporter anymore thanks to another

name:Samantha bee

text:yearbook revelation so in this 1983
Georgetown Prep yearbook you have 14
references to a young lady by the name
of Renata judge Cavanaugh has a mention
of being a quote unquote Renata alumnus
Renata Schroeder was a young woman who

name:Samantha bee

text:attended a nearby Catholic school she
signed a petition I'm sorry a letter of
support for judge Kavanagh along with
about 64 other women who knew him during
that area era attesting to his high
character she did not know about the

name:Samantha bee

text:yearbook photos until very recently she
was very offended and hurt some former
classmates say the term is a veiled
boast about sexual conquests by the
young men listing her name but a public
relations representative said it merely

name:Samantha bee

text:alludes to quote innocent dates or dance
partners
innocent dates or dance partners are you
fucking kidding me
does this Jacquot think that no one else
remembers highschool 19 age boys do not

name:Samantha bee

text:all boast about being dance partners
with the same girl
this isn't Pride and Prejudice and even
if it were pride and prejudice saying
Lady Edith Debs the quadrille with nine
men yes tonight means you think Lady

name:Samantha bee

text:Edith is a whore Cavanaugh did to women
in high school and college a great way
to persuade us that he's not that guy
anymore would be to stop gaslighting
women now I'm having a little trouble
controlling my rage this week and while

name:Samantha bee

text:it has its upsides Sam give a light
thank you it's not a great week to be an
American woman as of the moment that I'm
taping this show I don't know if
Cavanaugh is gonna withdraw from the
nomination or if the GOP is gonna crown

the USS Frank cable I was raped by a
superior noncommissioned officer I was
ordered by my command not to report this

text:crime about 56% of estimated victims in
our military are men that was three
years ago we're catching up ladies but
sexual assault against men is a
long-standing military tradition
hence the Marine Corps motto semper why

name:Samantha bee

text:will you not stop touching my butt now
according to a DoD survey there were
more than 20,000 cases of sexual assault
in the military in 2014 although those
survey takers might be lying I'd have to
see what kind of clothes they were

name:Samantha bee

text:wearing of those only about 6,000 were
formally reported I wonder why service
members who reported a sexual assault
were 12 times more likely to suffer
retaliation that's either offender get
convicted of sexual offense

name:Samantha bee

text:there's no hilarious punch line in the
prompter hit writers I need another rape
joke
okay okay never mind it's been a fun
week now in the civilian justice process
when you report a sexual assault police

name:Samantha bee

text:investigate then a person with legal
training decides whether the case goes
forward and then a judge knocks the
sentence down to six months because your
rapist swims fast but your path to
justice looks like this now it might

name:Samantha bee

text:seem complex but once you get past the
Minotaur it's a breeze it's members must
report an assault to their commanders
however if those commanders take action
improve that an assault occurred they
also proved a failure of their own

name:Samantha bee

text:leadership
so commanders can't indict a rapist
without indicted themselves geez
Pentagon if you want to put your troops
in an unwinnable situation just send
them back to Iraq this this problem goes

name:Samantha bee

text:deep that's what she said
you commander set the tone if you take
sexual assault seriously the people in
your unit will too and if you don't well
we had a sexual assault and harassment
training that we went through and one of

stripped completely naked and danced and
laughed at it why would I go to a chain

name:Samantha bee

text:yesterday our commanders are
extraordinarily good at their jobs of
training troops and of winning wars they
aren't trained to be criminal
prosecutors they're not lawyers his
decision-making can be biased he may

name:Samantha bee

text:well know the perpetrator or the accuser
this bill will take the decision-making
about whether a crime has been committed
or not out of the chain of command and
give it to trained seasoned military
prosecutors well that seems like a

name:Samantha bee

text:reasonable solution to the oh no oh shit
here come the obstruction twins bill and
Buster probably wearing their adult
diapers so they can block this bill all
night i over whelmingly support this
bill and this crusade that Senator

name:Samantha bee

of sexual assault are afraid to report
the assault because
don't trust the current system this is a
common-sense reform oh my god
someday you'll tell your children you

name:Samantha bee

text:saw one but despite bipartisan support
from a majority of senators including
both party leaders the bill keeps
falling short of a filibuster-proof 60
votes possibly because the Pentagon has
been feeding Congress a k-ration of

name:Samantha bee

text:bullshit
her approach was to fire every commander
and replace the commander with a bunch
of military lawyers no one is firing
anyone military lawyers already exist
you're 60 Lindsay I know you watch jag

flower of unit cohesion that can only be
maintained by keeping rapists around

you
Thank you. Welcome back to the show
Trump's recent claim that judicial
impartiality was incompatible with hot

name:Samantha bee

text:latin blood was outrageous enough for
Paul Ryan to break out the r-word
Claiming a person can't do the job
because of their race is sort of like the
textbook definition of a racist comment
I think that should be absolutely disavowed. 
It's absolutely unacceptable
it's nice of CNN to include a countdown
clock to Trump's next absolutely
unacceptable statement. But racist or not,
the "brown judges aren't fair to me"

name:Samantha bee

text:argument is being made right now in the
Supreme Court which will decide as early
as tomorrow whether tribe members can
sue Dollar General for an alleged sexual
assault against a 13 year old boy
(REPORTER NARRATION) an attorney for Dollar General argued this violates the stores right to due
process, quote "we are a non-citizen, a non
member of the tribe and the trial jury
may be composed only of members of the
tribe" he said. Justice Sonia Sotomayor:

name:Samantha bee

text:"you're just assuming that these judges
are not neutral" Dollar General's taking a
stab at diminishing the tribal
sovereignty of all nations, not just one
ok, could someone please explain tribal
sovereignty in a way that Dollar General can understand?
Uh, Tribal sovereignty means
that, it's sovereign.
you're a, you're a, you've been given
sovereignty and you're viewed as a sovereign
entity

name:Samantha bee

text:well said, but this hasn't stopped the
supreme court over the years from
snatching away the tribal court's powers
the same way we snatched away their land
and most of their turquoise. But what are
tribal courts actually like? It was my
manifest destiny to find out
I traveled to the Cherokee reservation
in North Carolina to observe their
charmingly backwoods justice system
where peyote addled eders rendered

name:Samantha bee

text:verdict in there fairly new municipal
sweat lodge
my name is Bill Boyham and I'm the chief
justice of the Cherokee Supreme Court
how did you learn the law, was it passed
down by your ancestors in a spirit dream?
I went to law school at University of North
Carolina School of Law.
--ok gotcha
the reality is that our Court functions
much like every other state or federal
court in the United States

name:Samantha bee

text:isn't that what you want us to believe
and most certainly also the truth
Yes. That's not saying that all tribal
courts are perfect,
no court is perfect, all we're asking is
to be treated like any other court in the United States.
(SAM VOICEOVER) But their judicial
mumbo jumbo was too confusing to white
people
tell me about the mysterious symbols on
this celestial moon chart

name:Samantha bee

text:well this is a pretty typical court
calendar
(SAM VOICEOVER) ah, a court cal-en-dar. OK, this is
just a fucking court
so who besides a certain big box store
would argue with that?
I think it's very fair to say Tribal Courts should not be trusted
Ohh, this white lady
Elaine Wellman is an activist and leader
of the citizens Equal Rights Alliance, a

name:Samantha bee

text:group that opposes tribal sovereignty
works to take back native lands and
rallies with local lawmakers and
Senators to undo contracts tribes have
with the federal government.
Although currently active, she insisted
she was not speaking on behalf of her organization.
Tribal government controls
tribal court and tribal governments
would like to have all the white people
off the reservations

name:Samantha bee

text:ok, because it sounds to me like the
tribes just want us to go to their
courts and follow their laws when we're
on their land
they're all a threat to the US
Constitution and the private property
rights and the civil rights of American
citizens.
You make them sound so powerful.
--They are.
(SAM VOICEOVER) They're not. In fact, tribes have some

name:Samantha bee

text:serious judicial limitations imposed on
them by the supreme court.
If a non-Indian commits a crime with an Indian victim, we have no jurisdiction over that crime.
(SAM VOICEOVER) Yep, non-tribal people can pretty much do
what they want on tribal land and get
away with it
I'm unaware of any other courts in the
world that don't have jurisdiction over
their entire territory. You could punch
me in the face and there's really

name:Samantha bee

text:nothing I can do about it
I've never had permission to punch a
grown man before but I feel like you're
asking me to. 
--Not asking, I'm just using it to illustrate
--What if I urinated on your
house
we could not charge in tribal court for that.
-- I could graffiti your face
Yeah.

name:Samantha bee

text:can I resteal till your land?
--(murmur)
Could I vandalize your mom?
you can punch her.
--Punch her.
she's 93. 
--I could definitely punch your mom then.
Yeah.
(SAM VOICEOVER) here's how it works. Let's say I punch his 93 year old mother. She calls the cops,
they can't charge me because I'm a white
lady and I don't have to follow their
stupid rules

name:Samantha bee

text:So she tries the feds. They don't want to
take the case because it's so small and
the only recourse
he has available is to sue for damages
in tribal civil court. But that's a
recourse that big box stores like Dollar
General want to take away for good at
the Supreme Court.
Should the tribe be able to sue Dollar General in this case?
--I would say no.

name:Samantha bee

text:But Dollar General signed an agreement with the tribe.
--Yes, they had an agreement.
Umm, but...
--I guess we're used to breaking
treaties with the Native Americans, so
one more is not gonna hurt.
That's your statement, that's not mine.
No it's definitely my statement. I'm
definitely saying that. I am a hundred
percent saying that.
--Well,

name:Samantha bee

text:also I'm more of the belief that all
sides of broken treaties and an
advantage was taken on both sides
(SAM VOICEOVER) It's true. We have gotten all the land,
but they got all the sports teams
there's a certain number of people who,
once they learn they can commit crimes
without being punished are going to do
it again
so what you're saying is that Americans
are coming over tribal borders
--Yes.

name:Samantha bee

text:They're bringing crime
--yes 
They're rapists.
Some of them, yes.
--Some, you assume, are good people.
Yes.
--Where have I heard that before?
We may never know who said that.
But Elaine still thinks tribes
are getting special treatment
Many of them say we stole their land.
Well, we purchased their land. We have

name:Samantha bee

text:paid them off many times over. 
--This free ride doesn't last forever.
Well so far it has. If we always owe them
because we always stole their land and
they were here first,
what incentive do they have to forgive
or go forward?
Well they were here first, isn't that something?
--No. Why don't we all the blacks
forever, because we treated them like
animals?
--We do

name:Samantha bee

text:(SAM VOICEOVER) It's amazing who fills the vacuum of
information on Native American issues
simply because not enough people care to show up
And I'm not going away.
You can call me any name you want, but I
know where my heart is and I know what my
best hopes are for native people
What do people call you?
--They call me bigot, they call me racist, they call me KKK they

name:Samantha bee

text:call me, they
call me anything they want to.
(SAM VOICEOVER) But how would they get that impression?
the power of Sharia law might be very
very, vary influential on tribal courts
how did I know I was going to hear the
words "sharia law" today?
(SAM VOICEOVER) But maybe that's the solution. If enough
people think Native Americans are Sharia

name:Samantha bee

text:terrorists,
they'll finally get the attention they
deserve.
We'll be right back.
welcome back thanks largely to the NRA
is sensible campaign against gun
regulations gun violence has killed 70

name:Samantha bee

text:Americans and injured 145 in the past 72
days
oh I'm sorry wait my bad it's ours the
past 72 hours as of this taping but I
found out there's one thing the NRA
doesn't mind regulating I swear to god

name:Samantha bee

text:this story is 100% true when the NRA
isn't working tirelessly to make sure
our nation's guns can roam free they
occasionally teach gun safety to
children don't touch I'm Eddie Eagle and
I like you too much if your static gun

name:Samantha bee

text:just walk away that's Eddie Eagle the
NRA 's gun safety mascot who when not in
super lame cartoon form is sent around
the country patronizing children with
unlistenable raps about guns guns
shouldn't be left lying around yeah stop

name:Samantha bee

text:there's something about that costume so
mockable so asinine I had to have one
but it turned out the organization that
makes it easier to get a gun than
sudafed makes it nearly impossible to
acquire their giant dancing eagle

name:Samantha bee

text:the first step was completing the nras
18-page costume application which
includes 36 rules and regulations to
keep me from living out my Eagle
taunting fantasies
they've rules like an eagle doesn't

name:Samantha bee

text:drive any Eagle does not smoke or drink
alcohol and he's always clothed on top
of that I'd have to deal with their
mandatory 20-day waiting period who
wants to wait 20 days to get something
awesome that's not the America I know so

name:Samantha bee

text:I had it the free market somehow
different no haze probably because the
NRA banned the resale of Eddie Eagle so
it doesn't fall into the wrong hands you
know what I could still buy online
without a big hassle

name:Samantha bee

text:I used check gun and arms less calm from
a random guy down the road from the TBS
headquarters in Atlanta so I had one of
my employees buy it from him in a
parking lot without a background check
from the trunk of this car Oh

name:Samantha bee

text:mmm that hit the spot
but where was that Eagle hider still
have to find him Eagle program
experienced you so I called the NRA to
check their national registry of
costumes which is a real thing they have

name:Samantha bee

text:to make sure you know that they don't
lose track of any dangerous Eddie's like
gun collectors do you have one oh great
so I sent my team to the New Mexico gun
show to see about borrowing the costume
[Music]

name:Samantha bee

text:plenty of gun loving toddlers
no sign of Eddie anywhere we didn't want
to leave empty-handed so my producer set
out to pass the rigorous background
check no good thing felons never lie but
Eddie never showed up I was getting

name:Samantha bee

text:frustrated and frankly running out of
gun storage I still had one last shot
my lawyers scoured the NRA rulebook and
found a loophole the costume may be
purchased by a non-law enforcement
groups provided they sponsor gun safety

name:Samantha bee

text:trainings I could definitely appear to
do that so I had our lawyers spend
$1,000 to create an LLC for a plausible
safety group in North Carolina and we
spent weeks registering it with the IRS
getting website getting a P o box making

name:Samantha bee

text:hats this had to work are you gonna
marry I'm speaking oh hi Mary Ann I'm
with Western North Carolina Community
Safety Services we've been holding
safety trainings for kids since about
2016 I'm interested in purchasing one of

text:your Eddie Eagle costumes for a program
that I'm working on um so unfortunately
we only felt the mascot costume to a law
enforcement agencies no no no no no no
no no you can't you just you cannot just
keep adding rules that's not fair um I

name:Samantha bee

angry you needed a way to take out my
frustration oh I know a little retail

they took bit better but I couldn't give
up well maybe it was the magic of owning

gonna be in a local Home Builders Expo I
didn't stop to ask why I just got on

periods and your national registry but
you can't stop a criminal who's on her

shutdown but there is one thing they are
not willing to compromise on see if you
can figure out what it is from this clip
Express more willingness to negotiate on
that figure for Republicans to get past

text:this war I'm not for a wall
me again if I'm for a wall and I'll rip
your spine out through your face
motherfucker
Donald Trump's raging wall Boehner may
be The Fountainhead of this shutdown but

name:Samantha bee

text:the true bunghole court preventing a
functioning government is Senate
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at any
point in time he could bring a bill to
the floor allow it to go to the
president asked the President to veto

name:Samantha bee

text:and then override the veto he can it be
open the government no 67 senators and
chodri denied the congressman could be
open the government neocon Wayne Newton
is right Mitch rules Congress with an
iron flipper he could end this but he's

name:Samantha bee

text:hoping no one notices that McConnell is
allowing two bills to come to the floor
tomorrow but neither is expected to pass
the Democrat backed bill only funds the
government through February 8th and
doesn't give Trump as well so

name:Samantha bee

text:Republicans won't vote for it and the
Republican bill gives Trump the wall he
wants and restricts the rights of some
refugees and contains a clause that says
look at me I'm the Democratic senator
I'm so dumb I can't stop hating myself

name:Samantha bee

text:what am I getting myself so Democrats
probably won't vote for it I mean you
never know they're Democrats both of
these bills are non-starters but here's
the thing the Democrat backed bill is
virtually identical to a budget that the

name:Samantha bee

text:Senate unanimously approved in December
that budget didn't have any wall funding
either Senate Republicans don't give a
shit about the wall they're only keeping
the government shut because that's what
the president wants it's the same reason

name:Samantha bee

text:they changed our national bird to the
chicken nugget now we have to reprint
all of our money to say e pluribus yum
yum
Congress is a co-equal branch of
government it's not McConnell's job to

name:Samantha bee

text:bend the Senate to the president's whims
it's his job to help it govern even if
we had a normal president one who didn't
say things like this a lot of people
could say that if the World Trade Center
had asbestos it wouldn't have burned

name:Samantha bee

text:down it wouldn't have melted okay there
is truly nothing more on-brand for
Donald Trump s'en campaigning to bring
back asbestos we really need Congress to
stand up here it is impossible to
compromise with Donald Trump because

name:Samantha bee

text:there's simply no reason to believe that
he'll do anything he says he will he
said he'd protect daca recipients and
then announced he was gonna end daca he
said he'd protect the LGBTQ community
and then he ban transgender troops and

name:Samantha bee

text:let's not forget he said he didn't work
for Vladimir Putin and every day it is
looking increasingly likely that he very
fucking much does he's so far include
his pocket he's squished between his
borscht in his cyanide capsule but we

name:Samantha bee

text:know that governing involves compromise
but how can Democrats possibly
compromise with the least trustworthy
man in history look let me explain it in
terms everyone is going to understand
giving Donald Trump five billion dollars

name:Samantha bee

text:for a wall in 2019 would be like
investing in the fire festival in 2016
Nancy Pelosi is the sweet Dutch pilot
who's telling us everything about this
is terrible you have to give people
water and a place to shit Mitch

you
welcome back to the show white this
point in the show you may be slightly
down on legislators the state of Georgia
and humanity in general but I'm going to

name:Samantha bee

text:fix that because Georgia's Democratic
and Republican lawmakers also showed us
government at its very best remember a
year ago we told you about a rape kit
bill that was blocked here's the rest of
that story

name:Samantha bee

text:[Music]
we had an issue where rape kits were
just sitting on shelves well we're
talking thousands of kits this doesn't
often happen but we were able to come up
with the solution the bill mandates that

name:Samantha bee

text:the kits be prosecuted there wasn't a
person who I talked to an either party
who wasn't supportive of what we were
trying to do in the house and when it
came to the floor of the house it passed
unanimously when the bill went to the

name:Samantha bee

text:Senate and how do I say this nicely all
hell broke loose Renee Unterman is the
state senator who is the chair of the
committee to which the bill was assigned
and she refused to let the bill have a
hearing she felt that if there was a

name:Samantha bee

text:problem that she would have known about
it I think that she said that she would
have been johnny-on-the-spot
I would be johnny-on-the-spot she would
also argue that if there is a problem
then we can just wait till next year

name:Samantha bee

text:some of these kids have been sitting on
shelves for five or ten years why would
we want to wait another year before we
take action
there was a very direct recommendation
for me to not make an issue of it to

name:Samantha bee

text:just wait and let her handle it if
anything needed if you've done so I just
kept working and working working to try
to show her why this was so important
because we knew we had a problem but
there was no willingness to really

name:Samantha bee

text:listen we had four or five days left in
the session and it did not look
promising I was sitting at my desk and
one of the speaker's aides tapped me on
the shoulder and said the speaker would
like to talk to you and I'd been in the

name:Samantha bee

text:house for six years and I've never had
the speaker asked for my advice while
we're voting on bills before I'm David
Ralston
I'm the Speaker of the House of
Representatives in Georgia he asked very

name:Samantha bee

text:directly what the is wrong with Renee
when I looked at Scott Holcomb I didn't
see Scott Holcomb a Democrat I saw Scott
Holcomb a member of the House that had
good idea about something we needed to
do in Georgia speaker Ralston suggested

name:Samantha bee

text:to me that if a bill passes the house or
the Senate the other chamber can take
action and that action can include
completely stripping a bill and then
pasting a different bill onto it and so
the number stays the same but all of the

name:Samantha bee

text:content is completely different we
looked and looked and look for a bill
that would work but it has just weren't
a lot of options available to us and
there wasn't a lot of time Monday night
I had dinner with state senator Elena

name:Samantha bee

text:parent a Democrat who represents Atlanta
and she mentioned to me that she had a
bill that might be a possible option so
I told her I want to do it if you're ok
with it but I need you to understand
what that means that means the build

name:Samantha bee

text:that you worked hard on and passed I'm
just gonna delete it and I'm gonna
completely paste on the text from our
bill she didn't blink and she said do it
it's the right thing to do and then it
was off to the races we have to get it

name:Samantha bee

text:through the Rules Committee the House
and the Senate and we had two days left
I sent some messages over to the Senate
and they were gonna be casualties
legislatively that is if this measure
was not approved and on the last day the

name:Samantha bee

text:very first bill that was called was
Senate bill 3:04 when he called the bill
I went up and I presented it and then
the speaker asked questions I asked him
is it not true that this bill when it
was first before the House passed

name:Samantha bee

text:unanimously at that time I had been here
six years and I had never seen him ask
questions from the well and in that
manner and I think it's in a message
that hopefully gave a little push to the
bill and that was my intent and and it

name:Samantha bee

text:passed unanimously passed unanimously so
then it began the long process of
running back
forth between the House and the Senate
and the goal was have the bill called in
the Senate have it passed and then we'd

name:Samantha bee

text:be done was it called
no instead they looked for amendments
and they wanted amendments so they could
say that they made an improvement to the
bill and that made it more acceptable to
them so we have one hour left the bill

name:Samantha bee

text:finally was called by the Senate and it
passed and even sent her on to me voted
for the bill this is cool house rock on
steroids because has come back to the
house one more time because we have to
pass it in the exact same version as the

name:Samantha bee

text:Senate I ran out of the Senate and ran
back to the house I immediately started
thinking oh my goodness we have less
than an hour and in order to pass the
bill people have to see it
but we've 180 members so the physical

name:Samantha bee

text:act of making copies while they're busy
doing lots of other things because it's
the final minutes of the session and I
was worried that we weren't gonna have
enough time to get that finished the
Republican members said we're gonna help

name:Samantha bee

text:pass it out we're gonna help pass out
the physical copies and that's the side
of politics that people don't get to see
very often but it does happen when I got
called to present the bill the person
who was immediately in front of him as a

name:Samantha bee

text:preacher kept talking and talking and
talking but it wasn't a controversial
measure and I couldn't constrain myself
I'm sitting right in front of him and I
was yelling her I was saying shut up
when it finally came up I actually ran

name:Samantha bee

text:up and I recall saying this is the
legislation that will ensure the timely
processing a break gets in the state of
Georgia
we are good please vote yes and it
passed unanimously

name:Samantha bee

text:[Music]
and I think it was almost at the stroke
of midnight there was a standing ovation
by the entire House Republican and
Democrat often I gavel down ovations
because it's probably not all the time

name:Samantha bee

text:consistent with good decorum but I did
not gavel that down because he had
earned it
I waved to the survivors and the
advocates who were here and watched us
and then I saluted I saluted the speaker

name:Samantha bee

text:there was an example of I think how
people can come together to make a
difference in to to fix a very bad
problem and we did it we did it across
party lines and we did it in a
relentless way where we never gave up

name:Samantha bee

text:and I'm really proud of that we'll be
right back

Kellyanne Conway or as FoxNews calls her
the first woman to run a winning

first woman to run a successful

pretty much single-handedly while
raising four children and probably being

amazing at her job and she deserves

Conway was on the Left

but the left's not not big fans oh my

should be punished for having abortions

women should not have the right to vote
I would not want to be called a feminist
[Music]
long before Trump grabbed her for his
campaign

name:Samantha bee

text:Kellyanne was fighting for and/or
against women's rights always tackling
the issues that mattered most whether
that meant defending marriage by
attacking a PBS cartoon that featured a
child with two moms or speaking up for

name:Samantha bee

text:feminism at conservative gatherings
femininity is replacing feminism as a
leading attribute for American women if
women really want to be taken seriously
in the workforce these days looking
feminine is a good way to start it is

name:Samantha bee

text:important to always emphasize your
femininity that's why even the W in the
logo behind her was designed to look
like a pair of tits but as racists who
don't feel like racists keep telling us
we should never judge anyone by what

name:Samantha bee

text:they say or do but only by what's in
their heart and I know Killian doesn't
believe those homophobic sexist things
in her heart because Kellyanne doesn't
believe anything in her heart she will
say literally anything Exhibit A from

completely transparent Donald Trump's

not to mention both chambers and the

name:Samantha bee

text:to 25% of the baldwin brothers we are
talking about a lot of power here that
is no coincidence Republicans have put a
lot of strategies in place to stay in
power even when they're in the minority
like voter suppression such as this

name:Samantha bee

text:recent very brazen attempt in Georgia
election officials in a Georgia County
will vote this morning on a
controversial proposal to close 7 of its
9 voting places many community members
say that would hurt African American

name:Samantha bee

text:voters they tried to close down seven of
nine polling places the only reason they
didn't close down the other two is
because they were located inside a Jimmy
Buffett concert where black people could
never find them

name:Samantha bee

text:I wonder why they wanted to close
polling places in a predominantly black
county couldn't be to prevent the
election of America's first black woman
governor couldn't and now fired
consultant had recommended the closures

name:Samantha bee

text:because he said the precincts were not
in compliant with the Americans with
Disabilities Act you know what else is
gonna make it hard for disabled people
to vote not having a polling place don't
blame disabled people for your racism

name:Samantha bee

text:that's mean in about six different ways
the most shocking thing about this was
that for once it didn't work the county
election board voted down the proposal
and the polling places will remain open
but in a lot of places it's left to the

name:Samantha bee

text:courts to decide and the GOP has been
hard at work taking over those two I'm
sure you remember how they successfully
bench block to judicial Nome Merrick
garland and placed Buffy villain Neil
Gorsuch on the Supreme Court but what

name:Samantha bee

text:you may not know is that they've been
doing that at every level of the
judicial system Republicans in the
Senate blocked so many of Obama's
judicial nominees that they created 107
big juicy holes for Donald Trump to fill

name:Samantha bee

text:the nacio you're experiencing from
hearing me say big juicy holes for
Donald Trump to fill is exactly how you
should feel
because stacking the courts with
conservatives is deeply ominous for

name:Samantha bee

text:voting rights as just one example the
Supreme Court recently ruled five to
four including gore such that Ohio could
purge its voting rolls of inactive
voters that means every other state can
too we are gonna today not that kind of

name:Samantha bee

text:purge Florida don't get excited
but the pastor resistance and the main
reason why Republicans don't need anyone
to agree with them to win elections is
gerrymandering in 2010 Republicans took
advantage of the census year to go

name:Samantha bee

text:all-in on gerrymandering drawing
districts so skewed that North Carolina
looked like the aneurysm I have every
time I think about the year 2010 as
David Daly lays out in his book
rat-fucked the Republicans plan was the

name:Samantha bee

text:brainchild of Republican operative
Christian Kowski if you if you haven't
heard of him he's basically Karl Rove
without all that smoldering sex appeal
Jankowski created a project called red
map and buckle up because terrifying as

name:Samantha bee

text:it is boring what is red not red map is
a strategic plan to pull money on the
national level and invest it into the
key state legislative races where there
was going to be a redrawing of
congressional lines based on the census

name:Samantha bee

text:data and focusing on the states that
were either going to lose a
congressional seat or gain a
congressional seat to have maximum
impact oh I had a terrible dream that a
talking sports jacket broke democracy it

name:Samantha bee

text:was real
in order to redraw redistricting maps in
their favor Republicans targeted a few
key state legislature seats that had
never really faced large amounts of
campaign cash before poured a ton of

name:Samantha bee

text:money into them and buried Democratic
incumbents using negative ads like this
one which some say portrayed state
senator Margaret Dixon as a prostitute
Margaret Dix
not once not twice but three times

name:Samantha bee

text:busted special deals insider trading
no bid state contracts all for her own
game
what does Margaret Dixon really care
about to be fair that ad is not showing
her as a prostitute

name:Samantha bee

text:she's clearly leaving the money that
makes her the John it worked
Republicans won all the races they
needed to control key states
redistricting which led to the most
gerrymandered districts in history

name:Samantha bee

text:Republicans crammed as many Democrats as
possible into his few districts as
possible lacking in GOP majorities for
close to a decade
bottom line Republican votes actually
count more and they lost whatever

name:Samantha bee

text:incentive they had to work with the
other side but don't worry Chris doesn't
like feel bad or anything do you have
any regrets for something that you hope
to create no I just don't Trump is
president Nazis are back que sera sera

name:Samantha bee

text:because of all their judicial thefts
gerrymandering and folks oppressing
Republicans have made seemingly
competitive races almost impossible to
win in 2012 Democrats got over a million
more votes but Republicans won a thirty

name:Samantha bee

text:three seat advantage in the house and
the situation is still dire in fact the
districts are so skewed that according
to the Brennan Center in order to take
back the House Democrats would need to
turn out 15 million more voters than

name:Samantha bee

text:they did at the last midterms 15 million
where do they find those kinds of
numbers oh hang on a sec according to
USA Today 15 million people played
Pokemon go in 2016
I know what Democrats have to do

-We were talking backstage.
-Yeah.
-The last time you were here,
was right before
your show started.
-That's right.
Yes, two years ago.

name:Samantha bee

text:-Two years ago.
And the other guest that night
was an up-and-coming politician
named Hillary Clinton.
-Yes.
-And had you met her before?
-That was the first time
I ever met her.
And my friend Allana totally
rushed her in her dressing room
and made us
take a picture together.

name:Samantha bee

text:And it's so blurry,
'cause we're all too excited.
-That's great.
I think that's nice.
To have a photo so blurry
to show the moment is great.
-Exactly. Yeah.
-Compared to what
you thought it would be like
and what it's been like,
how has your show affected you

name:Samantha bee

text:over these last two years?
-Well, as a citizen, I would say
it's a similar experience,
where I thought
it was gonna be one way,
and it became another way.
-Yeah.
-But it's been a very wild ride.
It's been really fun,

name:Samantha bee

text:it's been invigorating
and terrifying,
and a lot of different things.
-Well that's good.
I certainly enjoy watching it.
Another show
I really enjoy watching --
You actually share a studio
with "Last Week Tonight,"
with John Oliver.

name:Samantha bee

text:-I do, yes, we share a space.
-And you guys have obviously
known each other
for a long time.
-Yeah, we have.
-You used to work together.
Sharing the same physical space,
do you ever leave notes
for one another?
-We never really
cross paths that much.

name:Samantha bee

text:But I did actually --
I did engrave my --
I did engrave something
in his desk.
And I don't know
if he knows that.
[ Laughter ]
I took, like --
I don't know.
I guess I was randomly
holding a knife.

name:Samantha bee

text:And I think, under his desk --
As one does.
Under his desk somewhere, it
says, like, "Sam Bee was here."
-Oh, that's great.
-Yeah.
-What a fun thing
to find one day.
-I know.
-And then probably
work backwards
to the same question of,

name:Samantha bee

text:"Why does Sam have a knife?"
-It's been years.
[ Laughter ]
I know.
-Your show, obviously,
very hard on the president,
to a point
that some people believe
there is
something shady going on.
There's a bit
of a conspiracy theory

name:Samantha bee

text:out there about your show.
-Yes, my dad has a lot
of friends, who think that --
They have conspiracy theories
about me.
They think that every time
I mention Hillary Clinton
I get $25.
[ Laughter ]
Which I do,
because we're best friends,

name:Samantha bee

text:but I'm sure you get that, too.
I mean, everybody thinks
that when you make jokes
in the typical comedy sphere,
that, like,
George Soros
provides you with...
Yeah, it's so funny to me
that no one thinks
you can just come to these
conclusions independently...

name:Samantha bee

text:-Yeah, no, no, no, no.
-...without cash reward.
-It's for a $25 per diem.
-Yeah.
[ Laughter ]
-Just cruising along
with all that
sweet, sweet George Soros cash.
-And last Friday --

name:Samantha bee

text:So, you guys are off
for a little bit.
-We were.
-'Cause obviously Friday --
We had to wait till today.
You guys
are gonna approach it
in two days, on Wednesday.
-I know.
You have to do it every day.
I'm so sorry.

name:Samantha bee

text:-No, but I --
[ Laughter ]
-I mean, like, no, it's good.
-I think
there are great difficulties
to doing it once a week,
as well.
-Yes, there are.
I mean, you get to cover --
You get to do it every day.

name:Samantha bee

text:-Well, I think it's --
So much is --
I'm trying to find
the right word for it.
So much is [bleep] out
every day that...
[ Laughter ]
...doing the show every day,
you're just like --
We're just running around
with a bucket.

name:Samantha bee

text:-Sure, totally.
-Like, you're an actual plumber
who like might actually
fix the toilet.
-We get the fire hose in the
face of feces, as well.
-Yeah.
[ Laughter ]
-But we get to sit back
and kind of analyze for,

name:Samantha bee

text:you know,
a couple of days at least.
But, you know, there's a lot of
man things to talk about.
-Yeah.
You, uh...
[ Laughter ]
-Not you.
-No, no, I know.
But there are --
Being on Team Man,
it's been a --

name:Samantha bee

text:I feel like we're not a --
not a great week.
We need to fire our coach
and hire a new GM or something.
-I know, you do.
[ Laughter ]
-But on Friday, obviously,
the plea deal happens.
-Uh-huh.
-And what is the reaction
in the "Full Frontal" offices?

name:Samantha bee

text:-Uh, well...
Okay, there's a moment --
I guess,
when it comes to the plea deal,
it really is sad
what passes for joy.
-Yeah.
-Because you feel that --
where you're like,
"Oh, it's so exciting!"

name:Samantha bee

text:And then you're like,
"Every smile is joyless.
Every piece of laughter
is mirthless."
Like, I remember I woke up
Friday morning,
and I listen to the
New York Times podcast,
and they were really
intensely talking about
how the tax bill was like
a trillion dollars off.

name:Samantha bee

text:And I LOL'd.
I was like, "Ha ha ha!
A trillion dollars?!
Ha ha ha ha!
Oh, my God."
[ Laughter ]
And then --
And then, it passed.
It's really a trillion and a
half, don't worry.
-We listen to the same podcast.

name:Samantha bee

text:I don't know
if you found this recently.
-The music
is very triggering now.
-The music is triggering.
It's "The Daily."
It's fantastic.
Sometimes the news is so bad
that I just speed it up.
Like, I try to listen to it
just talking very fast, like,

name:Samantha bee

text:"And now it looks like
Republicans will pass the bill,
and it's gonna be $1.5 trillion.
It's gonna hurt
the middle class."
I'm like, "Oh, just get it out!
Just get it out!"
[ Laughter ]
I don't want to spend
a lot of time with this.

when we talk about white supremacy in
politics these days we tend to focus on
the nightmare gang of scooby-doo
villains that came to Washington in the
past couple of years but even before

name:Samantha bee

text:they slithered into town we already had
white nationalists serving in government
foremost among them Steve King he's the
congressman from Iowa's fourth district
he also happens to be the district's
most disgraceful white supremacist

name:Samantha bee

text:barely edging out the runner-up a cow
named Adolph heifer
here some of Steve's greatest hits
if we brought let's just say a billion
people from the from the continent of
India Indians into America would that

name:Samantha bee

text:change America would we ever become that
which we are and have been the America
that I love this Western civilization
still is a superior civilization and
certain groups of people will do more
from a productive side than other groups

name:Samantha bee

text:of people will that's just as difficult
fact put a little bit of wire on top
here to provide a disincentive for
people to climb over the top or put a
ladder there
we can also electrify this this wire we

name:Samantha bee

text:do that with livestock all the time that
is all really horrible but to be fair
party leadership did punish him with a
firm back pass how racist is this
live-action Disney villain for one thing
until recently he kept a confederate

name:Samantha bee

text:flag on his desk even though again he's
from Iowa which was on the Union side
and in case that was too subtle for
anyone he placed his desk on a
Confederate statue
Steve King also fought to have English

name:Samantha bee

text:declared the official language not to be
confused with Iowa's unofficial language
carving butter with Christ for help and
I almost forgot to mention Steve King is
also really into neo-nazis Republican
Congressman Steve King a hardliner on

name:Samantha bee

text:immigration tells CNN he didn't realize
he retweeted a message from a
self-described Nazi sympathizer but he
is refusing to delete the tweet I'm not
deleting that because then you all pile
on me and say King had to apologize he

name:Samantha bee

text:was wrong he knows he's guilty I'm not I
don't feel guilty one bit I'm sure he
says he's not guilty but then the next
day he came out with this book Steve's
excuse that he didn't know he was
promoting a Nazi sympathizer would have

name:Samantha bee

text:been a lot more plausible if he didn't
go on to promote another Nazi
sympathizer King tweeted his support for
faith Goldie she's a candidate for mayor
of Toronto and an unapologetic neo Nazi
sympathizer Goldie was fired last year

name:Samantha bee

text:from a far-right news outlet after she
appeared on a podcast produced by the
neo-nazi website The Daily stormer
she's also questioned whether
immigration is contributing to a white
genocide in Canada yeah there's racism

name:Samantha bee

text:and then there's I don't think Canada is
white enough racism I mean what is up
with the phrase white genocide genocide
means that you and everyone like you
will be murdered not that your daughter
might marry a black guy it's not a

name:Samantha bee

text:genocide if it includes gift bags and a
make-your-own-sundae bar
but Steve Kang is very concerned about
white people
you cannot rebuild your civilization
with somebody else's babies this is an

name:Samantha bee

text:effort on the left I think to break down
the American civilization in the
American culture and turn it into
something entirely different
calm down Steve it's not our fault that
nobody wants to fuck people like you

name:Samantha bee

text:isn't just a blowhard he's normalizing
far-right views both here and abroad
after a trip to Austria Steve King said
that Austria's freedom Party which was
founded by a Nazi in is the 21st century
edition of the Nazi Party if they were

name:Samantha bee

text:in America pushing the platform that
they push they would be Republicans oh
my god did Steve didn't you see Nazis
are Republicans such a moral morning
when you read the headline Samantha P
says Republicans or Nazis remember I

name:Samantha bee

text:didn't say that Steve King said it now
you might be wondering why was Steve
King even meeting with a Nazi lead party
in Austria anyway turns out he was on a
Holocaust Memorial trip oh he must have
been so disappointed to learn that

name:Samantha bee

text:Holocaust memorials usually take the
anti Holocaust side how did this
leathery used Volkswagen salesman even
get into Congress was he appointed in
some crazy King Ralph situation believe
it or not he was elected on purpose not

name:Samantha bee

text:once not twice but eight times further
proof that IO makes terrible decisions
and has no business being first in the
caucuses as if it weren't enough that we
have to watch every politician filleted
corn dogs at the State Fair

name:Samantha bee

text:but as insane as he seems Steve King
isn't that much of an outlier in today's
Republican Party I mean sure he blurts
out all the stuff you're not supposed to
say out loud but he's rarely denounced
by his fellow conservatives who are

name:Samantha bee

text:instead focused on calling out the true
threat to our nation late night
comedians which is fair we've all seen
the violent acts inspired by Jimmy
Fallon's lip-sync battles
Steve King has consistently spewed

name:Samantha bee

text:racism for 16 years with only the
occasional half-hearted reprimand from
his party when Paul Ryan was asked about
Kings thoughts on what color our babies
should be he yelled tax cuts through a
smoke bomb disappear why can't repeal ik

name:Samantha bee

text:ins just say racism is bad even if you
don't mean it just say the words here's
how there's anyone who has mistakenly
attached himself to our party in the
belief that we're not open to citizens
of every race and religion then let me

name:Samantha bee

text:remind you tonight this Hall belongs to
the party of Lincoln and the exits which
are clearly marked are for you to walk
out of as I stand this ground without
compromise see there's a guy who knows
how to say the tough things like racists

name:Samantha bee

text:aren't welcome here and buy these boner
pills remember when this was weird
politics memories well yesterday the
Republicans finally stepped up one of
them a little bit the chair of the
National Republican Congressional

name:Samantha bee

and it only took 16 years I look forward
to 16 years from now when President Paul

Trump's racism we'll be right back

Welcome back to the show! Despite initial concerns the DNC was a
week of reconciliation where former
enemies made peace with one another
Barack Obama hugged it out with his 2008
rival while Howard Dean seen here,
apparently in the Star Trek holodeck,
embraced his most lethal foe, his own

name:Samantha bee

This race is going to be won on the
ground and it's going to be won in
Colorado and in Iowa and North Carolina
and Michigan and Florida and Pennsylvania
And then we're going to the White House!
Oh screamin' Dean, you were just ahead of
your time
most impressive of all was Bernie
Sanders, who showed true character and

name:Samantha bee

text:grace teaming up with his former
opponent to fight the possible
extinction of life on the planet
thanks to Bernie's leadership the party
rift was healed
I want to thank Bernie Sanders
I will vote for Hillary with gusto.
We all should feel the burn!

name:Samantha bee

text:My forever friend, Bernie Sanders
There was a significant coming together
Ew, knock it off off Democrats, we don't want
to hear about what happened on the
backstage on the pile of coats, ugh! But the progressive heavy petting session was
occasionally interrupted by a handful of
Bernie or Bust diehards who, upset at
the undemocratic fact that the other
candidate got over 3 million more votes

name:Samantha bee

text:than theirs, responded by constructively
screaming abuse at anyone traitorous
enough not to be screaming abuse.
And tonight, this night, we're going to nominate a woman
(HECKLER) She stole it!
that would be the end
I may cry again tonight.
I said it two years ago
Uhhh, guys? If you're going to protest your
perceived disenfranchisement, maybe don't

name:Samantha bee

text:do it by heckling the guy who wrote the
book on protesting actual
disenfranchisement. John Lewis has spent more than 50 years
fighting a civil rights battle that's
not yet over
Wanna see how bitter he is?
(singing) I'm so happy
(singing) I'm happy

name:Samantha bee

text:(singing) this my song!
If John Lewis can overcome being beaten
by cops for securing black southerners
the right to vote
you can overcome the fact that a lot of
them voted for Hillary. You think
incremental progress is bullshit?
:ook at the entire Wyoming delegation
proudly wearing Black Lives Matter

Wyoming! Cheney country is getting woke!
So, what do these Bernie or bust motherfuckers want?
How do they plan to get it? And when will
it be safe to go back on Facebook?
I sent Allana Harkin to find out.
(ALLANA) Heading into
the convention, the Democratic Party was

name:Samantha bee

text:unified to beat Trump.
Bernie or bust!
(ALLANA) While the Bernie or Bust people were unified to beat the Democrats.
We're voting for Bernie, we're pushing Bernie.
Hell no we're not voting for Hillary.
Hell no this is not okay.

name:Samantha bee

text:We do not want Hillary.
That's why we're here protesting. We do
not want her. 
(ALLANA) Do you think Bernie still
still has a chance?
Absolutely.
I mean, I've only ran into all of two
Hillary Clinton supporters today
everybody else I've seen walking around
Philly's got Bernie shirts on

name:Samantha bee

text:Now something just doesn't add up, you
know.
(ALLANA) I also think it's where you are right now.
(Screaming) Bernie!
(Chanting Bernie beats Trump, Bernie beats Trump
(ALLANA) I'm so confused, cause isn't Bernie endorsing Hillary?
He has endorsed Hillary, he still has not conceded.
He said watch out for the roll call vote today.
(ALLANA) Mmmhmm.
We're gonna see.

name:Samantha bee

text:We have 1900 delegates here.  We'll see what happens tonight.
(ALLANA) Ohh!
(ALLANA VOICEOVER) A secret plan! So I went to watch the roll call vote to see Bernie pull off this
coup once and for all.
(BERNIE) And I move that Hillary Clinton be selected as the
nominee of the Democratic Party for President of the United States.
(ALLANA) It was a tough loss. They'd worked hard, but now that we're finally ready to unite
the party with yet another protest

name:Samantha bee

text:What's going on?
(MAN) We were just fucked.
(ALLANA) What's happened? Who got fucked?
(ALLANA VOICEOVER) And like any domestic dispute,
what began with shouting, ended with the
silent treatment
(ALLANA) Quiet? Why? Why? Why?
First time everybody's been quiet!

name:Samantha bee

text:Ahh, it's like going to the spa.
But these sad mimes still couldn't stop
Hillary from breaking out of the Phantom
Zone to rule us all
So now are you Bernie or Busters on board?
What could Hillary do to win your vote?
Nothing.

name:Samantha bee

text:Crawl in a hole. Yeah. Drops to hell where she belongs.
(ALLANA) But by not voting for Hillary, you're kind of voting for Trump! Yay!
There's also Jill Stein.
(ALLANA VOICEOVER) In fact, a quarter Bernie supporters are effectively siding with Trump and if
If they didn't want Trump to win they
should have let Bernie have the
nomination.
(ALLANA VOICEOVER) But that's not how voting works.

name:Samantha bee

text:And besides, Bernie won
the platform!
Do you feel that this movement has has
really pushed Hillary to the left?
Hillary Clinton has literally stolen
almost word for word
Bernie's platform.
(ALLANA) Isn't that a good thing?
I mean, absolutely not. I mean, that's just

name:Samantha bee

text:a further testament of how she is
willing to do and say anything to get
where she wants to be in office
(ALLANA) Even if she's saying and doing the right things?
I mean, it doesn't, you know, it
doesn't matter if you're saying and
doing the right things
(ALLANA VOICEOVER) Just say it, you think she's a bitch.

name:Samantha bee

text:I would sooner vote for Donald Trump than I would
Hillary Clinton.
I honestly think Hillary is worse than Trump.
I think she's much more dangerous than Trump.
He might turn out to be the lesser of two evils! Trump, imagine that!
(ALLANA) No, he's a hundred percent the greater of two evils.

name:Samantha bee

text:if it's gonna be Trump for four years,
brace yourself
It's gonna be a ride.
And what about all the Muslims and Latinos who are going to
be shipped out of the country
I believe that's what are our senators
and congressmen have to put a stop to
Do you feel extra comforted because you're
white and you don't have to deal with

name:Samantha bee

text:that problem?
To tell you the truth I'm in the bubble,
yes
(ALLANA VOICEOVER) So you're fine with the guy who's getting one hundred percent of the white
supremacist vote.
They're bigots, they're racists, all that, I get that. But they realized the need for the complete
burning down of the corrupt political system.

name:Samantha bee

text:(ALLANA) You wanna to be on the same page as the
Republicans?
At least we're on the same page with somebody.
(ALLANA VOICEOVER) Was this the unity they had hoped for?
(chanting) Lock her up, lock her up, lock her up
(ALLANA VOICEOVER) Where was I? What party is this?
Not a Democrat, I am a Bernie Bro!

name:Samantha bee

text:(ALLANA VOICEOVER) You know bro, it might be just about time to drop the word "Bernie"
We'll be right back
the GOP establishment is in a pickle
because the only guy within striking

someone they hate just as much Ted Cruz

name:Samantha bee

text:he's the one that everyone literally
everyone it seems like sometimes
genuinely truly hates he's shown no
qualifications no legislation being
passed doesn't provide leadership if you
killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the

name:Samantha bee

text:Senate and the trial was in the senate
nobody could convict you
a lot of good candidates I like nearly
all of them Bob Dole singled Ted out for
hatred and Bob Dole has fought actual
Nazis so who is Ted Cruz and why is he

name:Samantha bee

text:so hated and how come he always looks
like he's covered in a glistening layer
of slime even though we know that can't
possibly be true
Raffaele Edward Cruz was born in Canada
the son of a former Cuban revolutionary

name:Samantha bee

text:and a soiled back issue of national
review in his autobiography Cruz writes
about realizing he wasn't well liked in
high school in deciding what is it the
popular kids do
I will consciously emulate that which is

he'd set up easels and write summaries

actually was Ted Cruz yes you can watch

because her dad wants to have sex with
her according to Samantha B and then she

name:Samantha bee

text:should stump for Samantha B's preferred
immigration policy well all of this
broke and the write predictably and
correctly went nuts they said this is
insane why would you go after Ivanka
Trump this way we just had a controversy

name:Samantha bee

text:in which Roseanne Barr lost her show for
using a racist slur against Valerie
Jarrett and her show actually had
ratings unlike Samantha B's show where
seven people watch it including Samantha
B's immediate family and yet Samantha B

name:Samantha bee

text:still gets to remain on air now I'm not
calling for Samantha B to be fired
because frankly I think that her viewers
got exactly what they were looking for I
think TBS hired her knowing full well
what they were getting

name:Samantha bee

text:I think the Roseann situation is just a
little bit different in the sense that
when Roseanne's creators decided to put
her on the air they were not fully
expecting that she was going to do this
and it sort of undercuts the integrity

name:Samantha bee

text:of their products Samantha bee didn't
undercut the integrity of her products
this is her product her product is being
a vile terrible person who says vile
terrible things about people who she
disagrees with right that is her product

name:Samantha bee

text:so I don't see why she should be thrown
off her air for promoting her product I
also don't see why samantha bee should
apologize because her apology is gonna
be fake anyway okay so she did apologize
yesterday she put out a statement saying

name:Samantha bee

text:that she crossed a line right her
original apology is just ridiculous she
says I would like to sincerely apologize
to Ivanka Trump and to my viewers for
using an expletive on my show to
describe her last night it was

name:Samantha bee

text:inappropriate and inexcusable I crossed
a line and I deeply regretted okay do
you really believe that Samantha bee
deeply regrets it or is that or is it
that advertisers were starting to drop
out of her show I don't think she deeply

name:Samantha bee

text:regrets it I think that's a bunch of
horse poopoo I don't think that's
correct
at all and then CBS put out its own
apology quote Samantha bee has taken the
right action in apologizing for the

name:Samantha bee

text:violin inappropriate language she used
about Ivanka Trump last night those
words should not have been aired it was
our mistake to and we regret it well
damn right it's your mistake Samiha
to be unlike Roseann who's just tweeting

name:Samantha bee

text:out crazy stuff because it was late at
night and Roseanne's a crazy person who
takes ambien okay I actually believe her
ambien story in the sense that Roseann
is actually a crazy person and ambien
makes crazier crazy people crazier

name:Samantha bee

text:it makes sane people a little bit
crazier does making racist but if you're
a little racist can make it more racist
presumably but in any case TBS's
statement that they are responsible this
is correct

name:Samantha bee

text:Samantha B's rant was scripted it was
put into the script it was filmed it was
distributed it was greenlit everybody at
every step of the way had an opportunity
to say guys this might be a little over
the top but they didn't because why

name:Samantha bee

text:would they because this is what Samantha
P does for a living I mean there's
nothing and and how do you how do I know
that this is fake here's how I know this
is fake so it demonstrates just how tied
in Samantha B is to the mentality of the

name:Samantha bee

text:left you know what has happened to
Samantha bee over the last 24 hours
there was a tweet from Chris Hayes that
was just inane about Rosanna basically
saying that Roseanne's worldview
represents a large segment of the Trump

name:Samantha bee

text:base or significant segments of the
Trump base that's what he had suggested
there's no evidence to suggest that at
all that large segments in the Trump
base believe the valerie jarrett looks
like an ape or believe that it's

name:Samantha bee

text:appropriate to say such things in the
first place right that's just absurd and
there's no evidence to support it
there's pretty good evidence to support
the idea that a lot of Samantha B's base
are Hillary Clinton's base and they all

name:Samantha bee

text:believe what Samantha B just said you
know it's really funny I was in a
wedding for my sister over the weekend
and a person who shall remain nameless
came up to me and was talking about
politics a little bit and at one point

name:Samantha bee

text:actually said I wish someone would shoot
Donald Trump and I said are you insane
like why would you say that they know
that's it that's a no but he said this
is like normal conversation because this
is the way a lot of people on the left

name:Samantha bee

text:think well this is also true for
Samantha bee right because Samantha bee
how do I know that this is also that her
apology was false and that a bunch of
people defended her because her apology
was false and a bunch of people defended

name:Samantha bee

text:her for so first her fake apology so she
sent that apology she's so sorry then
she got an award I'm not kidding she got
an award from the television Academy for
social change right because she's a good
person who infects social change by

name:Samantha bee

text:shouting the c-word on air about Ivanka
Trump for holding her baby
so here is what Samantha the funny part
television Academy does the social
change award about freedom in the media
Free Press

name:Samantha bee

text:Samantha be changing the world and they
bar the press they will generally bar
Media from essentially a free press
celebration award because Samantha B was
in a lot of hot water so it doesn't
matter her speech leaked anyway and

name:Samantha bee

text:here's what Samantha bee said she said
quote every week I strive to show the
world as I see it unfiltered sometimes I
should probably have a filter I accept
that I take it seriously when I get it
right

name:Samantha bee

text:and I do take responsibility when I get
it wrong we spent the day wrestling with
the repercussions of one bad word when
we all should have spent the day
incensed that as a nation we are
wrenching children from their parents

name:Samantha bee

text:and treating people legally seeking
asylum as criminals okay mmm so you
apologize but it's our fault so it's my
fault
so I got offended that you called Ivanka
Trump the c-word and that's my fault

name:Samantha bee

text:because really I should be more worried
about the children at the border in
which case it should be okay that you
called her a C word in which case is
totally fine to call her a C word that's
the logic here okay the logic here is

name:Samantha bee

text:that Samantha me did nothing wrong and
of course she believes she did nothing
wrong is all nonsense they're a bunch
points to make on this particular topic
first of all I want to point out a bunch
of folks on the left actually support

name:Samantha bee

text:Samantha B's language unlike Roseanne
who found no defenders okay even the
people who are saying that you should be
left on air we're not defending her
actual comments Samantha bee actually
found defenders in the press she found

name:Samantha bee

text:defenders in Hollywood it's really
absurd so let's start with Joss Whedon
so Joss Whedon who's just a gross human
race is a gross person talented director
gross person quite possible happens all
the time here is what Joss Whedon

name:Samantha bee

text:tweeted quote Ivanka legitimized Trump
by being pretty and seeming sane well
what what like why is that why is that
her problem Ivanka legitimized Trump by
being pretty and seeming sane and libs
created a kind of sexist Rapunzel

name:Samantha bee

text:narrative that she was trapped she's
from a crime family she married into a
crime family she's a grown up she will
do as much damage as she can get away
with Sam was too kind so yes this
happens to be a fairly widely held

name:Samantha bee

text:opinion on the left is that Ivanka Trump
is an emissary of evil and then Sally
Field who you have not heard of for
years and it turns out that she doesn't
like Ivanka she really doesn't like
Ivanka she says I like Samantha be a lot

name:Samantha bee

text:but she is flat wrong it's called Ivanka
a c-word see words are powerful
beautiful nurturing and honest okay and
so I have a few questions about this
well I mean we can start with the
question as to what makes a body part

name:Samantha bee

text:honest that's kind of weird
I'm not sure why the body part is also
nurturing that was kind of weird as well
but in any case sadly field defending
the actual commentary and then there's
of course CNN analyst who loved the

name:Samantha bee

text:tweet CNN analyst named Brian carom he
to our ha ok best tweet of the day young
lady to Sally Field who again has not
been relevant since she did basically
mrs. Doubtfire I guess she was in
Lincoln for like five minutes but she is

name:Samantha bee

text:of course an emissary of Hollywood and
Hollywood is very much in favor of
Samantha B Kathy Griffin of course came
out and defended Samantha be no shock
there cuz Kathy Griffin is gross what's
hilarious is that the mainstream media

name:Samantha bee

text:also defended Samantha B's so I just
have to give you some of the some of the
headlines from the media say now
remember the headline about Roseanne
Barr is Roseanne Barr tweets racist
nonsense at Valerie Jarrett or Roseanne

name:Samantha bee

text:Barr calls Valerie Jordan ape or
whatever the headline was but they're
all anti Roseanne Barr obviously okay
then there's the media's coverage of the
of the of the Samantha be comments hey
these are headlines Kay here's a

name:Samantha bee

text:headline from USA Today the headline
from USA Today was Samantha B has a
message for Ivanka Trump has a message
for Ivanka Trump she called her a
feckless c-word and suggested that she
should have sex with her own father

name:Samantha bee

text:that's not really a message so much as
you know calling her a feckless c-word I
mean imagine if they'd run a headline
and said Roseanne Barr has a message for
Valerie Jarrett things absurd this is
ridiculous and here's what the

name:Samantha bee

text:Washington Post went with okay this is
their headline why the C word is so
taboo and why some women want to reclaim
it because you see Samantha bee actually
was reclaiming the C word for women by
calling another woman the C word she was

name:Samantha bee

text:reclaim it feminism means calling women
you don't like the C word just like good
race relations mean calling people you
don't like the N word you know this is
what I do when I want to have a good
relations with another Jew the first

name:Samantha bee

text:thing I do is I break out the K word and
I just use that all the time I mean you
can ask you can ask Jess every time I'm
angry with Jess you know just in order
so that we can get close I use the S
word to describe which is something that

name:Samantha bee

text:I do you know it's like what in the
world but this is coming from a
Washington Post the C word is taboo but
some women want to reclaim it by calling
other women the c-word because they hate
them

name:Samantha bee

text:yes you definitely reclaim the C word
for feminism well-done media okay and
then it can seem better here's the New
York Times headline on this thing so the
New York Times tweeted out Samantha bee
dedicated nearly seven minutes a

name:Samantha bee

text:full-frontal with Samantha bee
to the issue of migrant children before
using a crude term to describe Ivanka
Trump she's a hero don't you see
she spent minutes talking about
immigration policy before she dropped

name:Samantha bee

text:that line I mean you couldn't say about
Roseanne Barr
so her example created many hours of
wonderful entertainment before dropping
a crude term to describe Valerie Jarrett
of course you never hear that right

name:Samantha bee

text:because it's idiotic
but New York Times this has to defend
Samantha me so this is what's hilarious
Chris Hayes spends time trying to
proclaim that people on the right
support Roseanne Barr and Trump for the

name:Samantha bee

text:same reason which is that they all think
like Roseanne Barr by Valerie Jarrett no
evidence of that but the entire left
comes out essentially in support of
Samantha bee with maybe one exception
over at CNN Brooke Baldwin

name:Samantha bee

text:and we'll talk about in a second and
suddenly we're supposed to believe that
they are something different from
Samantha bee Samantha bee represents the
left far better than Roseanne Barr ever
represented the right this is not in it

name:Samantha bee

text:is not in doubt okay this is evidentiary
supported of course that is true and the
basic proof of that by the way is that
Samantha knee will not be pulled off the
air the reason that Roseanne Barr was
pulled off the air is not just because

name:Samantha bee

text:she said something terrible it's because
the network forecast that was going to
happen is that a bunch of people who
watch the Roseanne's show we're going to
turnout and boycott the show the same
will not happen to Samantha be her

name:Samantha bee

text:ratings will go up after this a bunch of
leftist who love this kind of stuff will
go watch her show specifically because
they feel the same way about Ivanka
Trump and Donald Trump and Samantha bee

the NRA a group that feels about guns
the way the rest of us feel about
natella a little is good more is better
and you can tell me it's bad for me all
you like but you will pry it from my

name:John Oliver

text:cold dead hands now in the wake of the
parklands shooting the NRA has found
themselves in the spotlight once more
however the public pressure this time is
actually starting to take a toll Twitter
users are pressuring companies

name:John Oliver

text:affiliated with a gun rights group by
using the hashtag boycott NRA so 15
companies have cut ties with the NRA
after Parkland I think we have a list of
them here some big ones you know Delta
United a Viet hurts basically saying

name:John Oliver

text:they're no longer going to provide
discounts to the NRA yes ie this budget
and Hertz will all stop providing
discounts to NRA members which will
presumably come as a huge blow to Jeremy
the one NRA member who was just in it

name:John Oliver

text:for the rental cars but the boycott
train hit a bit of a snag when it ran
into one of the NRA lesser-known side
ventures one group that hasn't been
swayed yet big tech companies like Apple
Amazon and Roku you see these companies

name:John Oliver

text:streaming services still offer access to
NRA TV the gun lobby groups free online
channel focused on pro-gun content okay
so that is an uncomfortable situation
for Apple and Amazon but it's a
miracle for Roku hurry hurry get in here

name:John Oliver

text:someone just called us a big tech
company they said like Amazon and Apple
it's happening Harry
all of the discussion this week of
boycotting NRA TV we thought it might be
worth answering the question what the

name:John Oliver

text: is that
because the truth is you may have
actually seen tiny bits of its
programming without even realizing it
like when this video featuring NRA
spokesperson Dana lash went viral just

name:John Oliver

text:last year they use their media to
assassinate real news they use their
schools to teach children that their
president is another Hitler the only way
we stop this the only way we save our
country and our freedom is to fight this

name:John Oliver

text:violence of Lies with a clenched fist of
truth yes the clenched fist of truth
which if you're looking for it is just a
little past the bent elbow of nonsense
and hiding in the overstuffed pocket of
needlessly aggressive metaphors now if

another one that made the rounds during
the Obama administration featuring
country music legends Charlie Daniels to
the Hyatt olace of Iran and every
terrorist you enable listen up you might

you haven't met the lake dog
he's a dog who lives in a lake for

met the Gators down in Cajun country who

take revenge on the swamp folk while

cycle of swamp folk Gator violence
that's the America I know and I promise

certain people shouldn't have guns how
stupid do you think we are bless your
heart
[Applause]
[Music]

name:John Oliver

text:now don't laugh he's absolutely right
and if NRA members are annoyed with what
I'm saying right now they should do the
exact same thing and smash their
expensive televisions with large
sledgehammers are you listening NRA

name:John Oliver

text:members destroy your own property it's a
really good idea and it's honestly the
only way we'll learn now NRA TV produces
a lot of videos like those that are
essentially just trolling for your
attention but their content goes much

name:John Oliver

text:much deeper than that as you will see if
you go to their website or if you watch
it on streaming devices like the great
and powerful Roku NRA TV has news
programming and there's honestly not
really much point in our showing you any

name:John Oliver

text:of that because it's essentially just
Fox News on a much lower budget what is
what is more surprising is they make
shows lots and lots of shows and they
are so much stranger than you would
think so tonight let's watch some NRA TV

name:John Oliver

text:together because it's fascinating
now some shows are pretty similar to
ones that you would see anywhere on TV
with the key difference that there is a
gun involved
for instance they have three different

name:John Oliver

text:Antiques Roadshow knock-offs in which
men who look like this guy gets
progressively more and more aroused by
the guns they're holding what's unique
is that it has such flowing lines its
artwork it's a sensuous gun that's the

name:John Oliver

text:kind of pistol that when I hold or when
John is holding it gives me shivers the
idea was is that you in town talk both
hammers yes same time that man is duck
Wicklund and I love him but not as much
as he loves guns in fact the only way he

name:John Oliver

text:could love them anymore is if instead of
bullets every gun just fired a bunch of
little guns which in turn fired a bunch
of even smaller guns which in turn fired
tiny dog Wicklund living in a state of
sexual ecstasy inside the womb like

name:John Oliver

text:paradise of a firearm and while that
show is pretty sedate NRA TV also has
programming for the testosterone-fueled
gun enthusiasts like Media Lab in which
a former Navy SEAL named Dom Rosso
the very important work of reenacting

name:John Oliver

text:movies he likes from White House down to
Jack Reacher and here he is reenacting
scenes from the movie heat the main part
of this movie that I wanted to break
down was the fact that they're shooting
moving and communicating and if we get

name:John Oliver

text:past the fact that they're robbing a
bank if you're actually in a specific
uniform with specific kit can you shoot
move communicate with that amount of
weight and do down mandrills that's the
key thing here I would love to see a

name:John Oliver

text:bank robber I try to use that defense in
court Your Honor I really feel we need
to get past the fact that we were
robbing a bank and instead focus on how
well we were shooting moving and
communicating and the endearing thing

name:John Oliver

text:about Dom Rosso is that he shows
reenactments don't always go smoothly
for instance how did his reenactment of
the heat robbery go they make it look
easy the way they're moving there this
Bay has that was run was just hitting at

name:John Oliver

text:the back of my knees have taken my legs
out from underneath me definitely
fatigued me my strap broke so I was
holding it like this the entire time
wobbling back and forth even in the
beginning couldn't get a stable shooting

name:John Oliver

text:platform and we worked it out had to
lower my center gravity more so the bag
couldn't control me
we definitely proved that they didn't
have any weight in there while they were
shooting move it wow that is genuinely

name:John Oliver

text:inspiring because somewhere out there
there's an eight-year-old asshole
watching that show and thinking oh good
being an adult is literally exactly how
I imagined it honestly I could talk
about Dom wrestle all night but before

name:John Oliver

text:we move on I have to show you his
inexplicable response to one viewer
submitted question what is your most
treasured possession I would say my art
gave me a cross that was made out of
bone she's like your

name:John Oliver

text:great-great-grandfather gave that to me
to pass down to somebody special in the
family but it was actually made out of
human bone and he carved it when he was
a prisoner of war
and that has been passed down on the

name:John Oliver

text:family now Mike are you serious I'm like
it just doesn't exist so that's probably
by far the coolest thing they have
well that's a hell of the story verdad
and I just don't know of any better
poster boy for the NRA than someone who

name:John Oliver

text:reenacts bank robberies for fun and
whose most treasured possession is a
cross made out of human bones but look
NRA TV isn't all gun bros there's also a
large amount of content aimed explicitly
at women there's even a whole women's

name:John Oliver

text:channel featuring shows like armed and
fabulous the NRA is actually making a
big push for women and they are pretty
clear about their motivations women
really have an incredible growth right
now in the NRA they are excited they're

name:John Oliver

text:enthusiastic they're there for us and
that's you know if you get the woman you
get the family if you get the woman you
get the family that is a brazenly
transparent statement of your marketing
strategy but to be honest can we just go

name:John Oliver

find that room relaxing is that a
soothing space for you
because I would be a little disturbed by
the extended family of gazelles
screaming why at me with their dead

name:John Oliver

text:glassy eyes now one of the NRA's female
focus programs love at first shot is
explicitly about getting women more
comfortable with the idea of owning or
firing guns and in one episode they took
a woman who was nervous about firearms

name:John Oliver

text:and really threw her in the deep end
they were gonna go straight into rifles
I'm gonna do it with an ar-15 okay I
know you've probably heard about them on
the news yes I hit the target you did
not as scary as I think I was

name:John Oliver

text:anticipated exactly it's just a nice
light push happiness yep a light puffs
of happiness it's a little weird to
describe a semi-automatic rifle the way
Bob Ross describes a cloud
but but once love at first shot has

name:John Oliver

text:women hooked the upselling begins which
does actually make sense industry
research has shown that women will spend
hundreds of dollars on accessories in
addition to their guns so you can kind
of understand why love at first shot

name:John Oliver

text:functions as a kind of QVC for firearms
showcasing products like mag loaders
targets gun cases and handbags okay so
as you see here I've got a couple of
different style options for you there
are a lot of different varieties of

name:John Oliver

text:exteriors but a lot of them really have
the same structure in terms of concealed
carries I never would have imagined
these little neat pockets and hidden
closures knowing that you can close it
it does put my mind at ease of that so

name:John Oliver

text:it's pretty cool go you don't even need
a gun because people are going to die
when they see that bag and look it's not
just handbags even the gun itself can be
profitably accessorized so yes we do
have a custom line of gun paint for the

name:John Oliver

text:ladies out there these mags look
phenomenal I love this product it's so
much fun to work with and it's great to
be able to put your own personal touch
on your firearms and your accessories oh
that's so fun that is so fun

name:John Oliver

text:oh if natalie ever commits murder a
grave oversight
good news chief the mag says the
killer's name right on it we don't know
what motivated them to go on a killing
spree but we do know she had a lot of

name:John Oliver

text:fun with it we've watched every single
episode of love at first shot and I have
to show you our favorite clip it's from
season 2 episode 1 the host natalie is
pregnant at this point so she can't join
in on the shooting but that doesn't mean

name:John Oliver

text:they didn't find a way to get her
involved we are going to make art for
Natalie since she couldn't be on the
range with us we're gonna do something
special for her to hang in her baby
nursery we know that you're expecting

name:John Oliver

text:obviously really thought we would make a
little something for it the baby's
nursery they shot paint so when somebody
inevitably asks why you have what
appears to be a blank canvas with a
large blood stain hanging up in your

name:John Oliver

text:Charles nursery you'll be able to
completely reassure them by saying oh
yeah my friend shots that for me but it
is not all fun with guns where an RA T V
really comes into its own is when its
tongue gets much darker which it does

name:John Oliver

text:for instance they have a series of
hunting videos which shouldn't be
surprising in fact it makes complete
sense people do use guns when they hunt
but while the visuals are predictable
Beauty shots of nature the voiceover

name:John Oliver

text:takes a different path somewhere over
this horizon sit a million little
dictators eager to purge humanity of its
hunting instincts the anti hunters had
imposed a false quarter
their lives based on a misconceived

name:John Oliver

text:perception of the world death is evil
they believe and so the purveyor of
death must also be evil death is an
undeniable fuel of life oh boy
God that is less planet Earth and more
deranged letter from a serial killer

name:John Oliver

text:although to be honest I would respect
the NR a a lot more if its slogan were
just the NRA because death is an
undeniable fuel of life I would like it
but at least we be clear where they were
coming from and that flowery vaguely

name:John Oliver

text:threatening tone is a key feature of NRA
TV here is another weird example hidden
beneath the dense canopy of deciduous
trees as a prostitute of sorts and those
who profit by selling her will stop at
nothing to exploit her sold and promoted

name:John Oliver

text:you are wondering why NRA TV is even
talking about drugs at all the final
defining characteristic of the network
is painting a bleak vision of America
with threats around every single corner
and one solution next attack on our soil

name:John Oliver

teenage girls are trafficked in sex
trade today's America is plagued by
urban riots and domestic Isis

you may call 9-1-1 and there may be

cartels and the human traffickers who
have invaded our borders and embedded in
every single American city this threat
is real
our leaders are either incapable of or

is one of the most effective tools
available to protect yourself and your
family holy they're using the same
techniques as an infomercial there is
human traffic getting you down do you

name:John Oliver

text:have Isis sympathisers in those
hard-to-reach places being tired of
getting 911 s there's got to be a better
way try the ar-15 available at way too
many stores near you now to watch NRA TV
is to watch a constant stream of stories

name:John Oliver

text:like those many of them real but
amplified to terrify you and sell you
products and there may be a good reason
that it sounds like an infomercial
because it is many of NRA TV shows are
sponsored by gun brands like Smith &

name:John Oliver

text:Wesson and behind the scenes of NRA TV
is an ad agency
it's called Ackerman McQueen they've
worked with the NRA for decades and the
Ackerman McQueen web site proclaims
every brand must be its own media

name:John Oliver

text:company and that is what the NRA have
done with their TV arm they've got a
product to sell and they employ people
who can sell that product well even Dana
lash the clenched fist of truth when
she's not warning a

in every single American city
she's just selling you some other

just one teaspoon of super beats gives

Dana 3 whole beets
that's more than my delicious superfood
medium beats it gives you the benefits
of two whole beets which is and this is
true enough that's a perfectly adequate

name:John Oliver

text:number of beats the point the whole
point here is the answer to the question
what the is NRA TV is it's just a
vessel to sell America guns that's
pretty much it does it work it's
honestly hard to say they won't reveal

name:John Oliver

text:their rating so it's plausible that no
one is watching this and that that ad
agency akima McQueen are making out like
bandits
but look having having watched a
shitload of NRA TVs programming here is

name:John Oliver

text:what I'll say about it there is a lot to
be concerned about regarding the NRA s
activities but NRA TV might actually be
the dumbest most transparent thing that
it does think about it this way if the
NRA is a ferocious bear charging at you

name:John Oliver

text:NRA TV is that Bears ridiculous hat is
it i catching sure it is is it
perversely entertaining absolutely is it
the main thing you should be worried
about probably not because the real
truth here is hat or no hat it is

name:John Oliver

text:imperative that everyone keep their eyes
on that bear and now this and
now proof that NRA TVs tone can make
anything seem scary has your kitchen
that once believed in the south glow of

Turkish authorities have identified 15

several of them were caught on camera

told the New York Times Saudi agents had
dismembered his body with a bone saw
they brought for the purpose it's
absolutely horrific and the Saudis deny
it happened although let us all agree on

immediate red flag thanks so much for
inviting me over for Thanksgiving Craig
the turkeys delicious the stuffing is
perfect that's a very large bone saw and
I just remembered I have to leave now

name:John Oliver

explain all the suspicious activity
surrounding his disappearance with the
Saudi own channel al arabiya claiming
that the 15 people who turned up in
Istanbul were just tourists which is

name:John Oliver

text:clearly given that flight logs
showed that most of the men arrived on a
private charter plane at 3:13 a.m. and
that all of them departed the same day
they arrived which is a pretty weird
vacation isn't it I want to see Istanbul

also the whole we were just tourists

friends had been suggesting for a long
time that we visit this wonderful town
Salisbury a wonderful town yes there's
the famous Salsbury Cathedral famous not
only in Europe but in the whole world

name:John Oliver

famous for its clock the one of the

incredibly grip because while this may
be the first that you have heard of
Jamar sociology he's long been a
significant figure in Saudi Arabia a
thoughtful and by no means radical

name:John Oliver

text:critic of the Saudi royal family and
this is all worried because the only
reason to kill a journalist in your own
consulate with 15 people and a bone saw
you flew in that day it's because you
wanted to send a message and you were

name:John Oliver

text:sure you could get away with it which
raises the question why would they be so
sure of that and part of that answer may
have to do with us so tonight let's take
a look at America's relationship with
Saudi Arabia because we have a long and

name:John Oliver

text:morally compromised history in in short
in very short four decades we have had a
relationship based on strategic
interests not shared values they have
oil we need it they opposed Iran and so
did we and for those and other reasons

name:John Oliver

text:US presidents have to varying degrees
been willing to pander to Saudi Arabia
and in doing so we conveniently turned a
blind eye to a lot of things from human
rights abuses to the Saudi leadership
role in funding religious extremism

name:John Oliver

text:even while partnering with us to fight
it it's always been a very complicated
relationship but in the last couple of
years it's actually gotten significantly
closer thanks to two new leaders Trump
and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and

name:John Oliver

text:let's take the prince first though his
father the king is still alive since
last year the prince has effectively
been running the country and has branded
himself as MPs the young new face of
Saudi Arabia he made the cover of Time

name:John Oliver

text:magazine under the headline charm
offensive and 60 minutes profiled him as
a progressive voice for the country his
reforms inside Saudi Arabia had been
revolutionary he is emancipating women
introducing music and cinema and

name:John Oliver

text:cracking down on corruption now there is
some truth to that he's attempted to
reduce the influence of some hardline
clerics he has agreed to let women drive
and he's allowed movie theaters after a
35-year ban although I will note that

name:John Oliver

text:one of the very first movies they showed
there was and this is true the Emoji
moon
which in hindsight is actually how it
was always supposed to be seen by a
group of people who had never seen a

name:John Oliver

text:good movie to compare it to now now all
of that has been combined with a major
plan to reorient the Saudi economy away
from oil and toward technology called
vision 2030
to that end MBS has gone on a world tour

name:John Oliver

text:this year to reassure investors that
Saudi Arabia is stable and progressive
and that businesses should feel
comfortable working with them he's
second meetings with Tim Cook Bill Gates
and Richard Branson and has eaten at

name:John Oliver

text:Starbucks with Michael Bloomberg
incidentally while the Starbucks
baristas miraculously nailed Mohammed
bin Salman and Bloomberg still ended up
with a cup reading Mikey Bloomberg as
part of his PR push NBS started an

name:John Oliver

text:annual business conference called the
future investment initiative or as it's
known Davos in the desert the first one
was held just last year at the
ritz-carlton in Riyadh featuring leaders
of many big-name companies as well as

name:John Oliver

text:the usual futuristic tech like
this we have smart investors here and
they are selective about what they
invest in well I think I'm special
I can use my expressive face to
communicate with people why is it

name:John Oliver

text:important for you to have an expressive
most of the time I feel positive oh god
oh god that is a creepy smile that's the
exact same smile that I've seen the
Queen give when she has to interact with

text:of contest to come to my house and look
at my things what a positive day for one
of us
don't touch anything but mbss PR push
isn't just toward attracting businesses
is also toward changing the world's

name:John Oliver

text:perception of Saudi Arabia to that end
he struck a 10-year deal with one of the
most popular and most American
franchises there is World Wrestling
Entertainment all WWE they held their
first of many events there back in April

name:John Oliver

text:and audiences around the world were
treated to Walther war propaganda about
the new Saudi Arabia including a video
showing women happily driving men
dancing and tourist destination beauty
shots as well as constant excited

text:compliments throughout the broadcast the
course of sunny on its feet that area
has been reserved for the Saudi royal
family the House of Saud I want to send
a genuine thank you to the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia Wow

name:John Oliver

text:it seems that WWE is avert approached
Audi Arabia as it is lately homoerotic
which is to say intensely but the truth
is MBS is far from the political
reformer that he's been presented as in
fact scratch any positive story about

name:John Oliver

text:him and you will find a much grimmer
truth underneath for instance what the
country did get headlines for ending its
ban on women driving just weeks before
authorities arrested about a dozen
female activists who'd campaigned for

name:John Oliver

text:the right to drive even that Investment
Conference had a dark coda because just
one week later at the exact same hotel
this happened new footage from inside
the ritz-carlton hotel in Saudi Arabia's
capital Riyadh shows the dramatic

name:John Oliver

text:transformation from a favorite haunt of
the well-heeled
into arguably the world's most luxurious
prison it's true MBS used that
ritz-carlton to lock up hundreds of
businessmen and members of the royal

name:John Oliver

text:family in a so-called anti-corruption
campaign at least 17 detainees were
reportedly hospitalized for physical
abuse and one Saudi military officer
died in custody which is obviously
insane and horrifying because the only

text:hotel where you expect to be murdered
days in paints their slogan days in
expect to be murdered here meanwhile bin
Salman has been aggressive with his
neighbors launching a blockade of Qatar
last year that continues to this day as

that has resulted in over 16,000
casualties and killed over 1,200
children the Saudi campaign of
airstrikes has been catastrophic as this
man attested while standing in front of

your family were killed twenty-seven
lives 27 people from one family can you
think of any reason why your family in
this house might have been struck I am

name:John Oliver

text:NOT a leader or anything
I work as a barber that's clearly
terrible and for the record at the very
least there is no justification for
violence against a barber and that is
coming from me if anyone has a

name:John Oliver

text:justification for a blood grudge against
barbers it would be yours truly because
of what they did to me and yes as all of
this has happened our current president
has continued to bend over backwards to
accommodate and ignore bin Salman zwarst

name:John Oliver

text:excesses and sometimes even celebrate
them after that clamp down on corruption
at the ritz-carlton
many around the world sounded the alarm
but Trump went the other way
Trump endorsed Crown Prince Mohammed bin

name:John Oliver

text:Salman s new corruption crackdown
tweeting quote I have great confidence
in King Salman and the crown prince of
Saudi Arabia they know exactly what they
are doing right but just because they
know what they're doing doesn't mean

name:John Oliver

text:that what they're doing is good Michael
Jordan knew exactly what he was doing
when he wore this moustache in a Hanes
commercial he was seeing how far this
whole Michael Jordan thing could take
him and the answer was apparently

name:John Oliver

text:through Hitler and beyond
and that that actually fits with the
larger pattern of Donald Trump and Saudi
Arabia because since taking office he is
catered to cater to them at every single
turn he made Saudi Arabia the first

name:John Oliver

text:foreign country he visited as president
and he seemed to have an absolutely
great time there
dancing with a sword and famously
groping a weird glowing or after which I
assume Michael Cohen instinctively

name:John Oliver

text:offered the orb 130,000 dollars and told
it to keep quiet and look it really
shouldn't be that surprising to anybody
that Trump has so enthusiastically
embraced the Saudi royal family they
have the two qualities he admires most

name:John Oliver

text:in the world having a lot of money and
giving it to him he basically said as
much on the campaign trail Saudi Arabia
and I get along great with all of them
they buy apartments from me they spend
40 million 50 million am I supposed to

name:John Oliver

text:dislike him I like him very much yeah of
course buying an apartment from Trump is
a surefire way to get him to like you
along with wearing one of his hats being
under 25 years old with a size 30 of
double D and not being Eric he's a he's

name:John Oliver

text:a simple man
it's simple tastes and Trump's
businessman view of the Saudis as just
people with money don't ask too many
questions
has carried over now that he's president

name:John Oliver

text:when bin Salman came to the White House
Trump called a press conference in the
Oval Office where he boasted about the
amount of arms that they were buying
from us essentially using MBS as a human
easel some of the things that have been

name:John Oliver

text:approved and are currently under
construction and will be delivered to
Saudi Arabia very soon and that's for
their protection but if you look in
terms of dollars three billion dollars
five hundred and thirty three million

name:John Oliver

text:dollars five hundred and twenty five
million dollars that's peanuts for you
eight hundred and eighty million dollars
six hundred and forty five million
dollars six billion dollars that's four
frigates

name:John Oliver

text:but first has any human in the history
of the world more obviously just learned
a word than he just learned a word
frigates but second look at bin Salman
face there as it hits him just how much
Trump likes money it's like the face of

name:John Oliver

text:a babysitter who realized you can pacify
a screaming kid with Twizzlers oh I
thought this was going to be difficult
but if all you want is Twizzlers I've
got loads of them here take all you want
and shut the up

name:John Oliver

text:and look look I am by no means saying
the Trump is the first u.s. president to
make distasteful arms deals with the
Saudis we've been doing it for decades
the Obama administration still sold them
weapons even as Saudi Arabia got

name:John Oliver

text:involved in Yemen but Trump has
continued doing so even assigned mante
of Saudi recklessness in airstrikes two
months ago they dropped an american-made
bomb on a school bus full of children
but just a month later Trump's defense

name:John Oliver

text:secretary said that Saudi Arabia was
doing everything it could to prevent
civilian casualties and we carried on
supporting them my point here is at
every turn Trump has gone out of his way
to accommodate the Saudis he doesn't

name:John Oliver

text:even have an ambassador to the kingdom
our relationship with them is being
handled personally by Jared Ivanka
Trump's realdoll and and the Saudis seem
understandably very happy with that
situation Krishna took an unannounced

name:John Oliver

text:trip to Saudi Arabia in 2017 to meet
with the young Prince months later and
Bs reportedly boasted that Kushner was
quote in his pocket which bin said man
deny yeah of course is in their pocket
he's Jared that face was born to

name:John Oliver

text:be maneuvered into someone's pockets his
Secret Service nickname is probably
wallet keys and a little bit of lint so
so while the fact that the US has
enabled Saudi Arabia is nothing new the
extent to which Trump is prioritizing

name:John Oliver

text:money above all else is really dangerous
is it any wonder that they have been
emboldened here after MPS's roundup of
his rivals Trump tweeted his support
after his blockade of Qatar Trump for
some reason took credit for it and that

name:John Oliver

text:kind of has consequences
time and again Trump has chosen extreme
friendliness with MPs
a leader who
in the words of one Saudi critic has
created a climate of fear and

name:John Oliver

text:intimidation going on to say we Saudis
deserve better
that critic was yamaja shogi the
journalists who is widely thought to
have been murdered in the Saudi
consulate and while Trump has said that

name:John Oliver

text:Saudi Arabia faces severe punishment if
it's proven they were behind this does
anyone really believe that that is
something that he's honestly committed
to a much more revealing response came
in the Oval Office after the news of her

name:John Oliver

text:jokey's disappearance broke just watch
him render in real-time the cost-benefit
analysis that he was applying to the
situation again just took place in
Turkey and to the best of our knowledge
Khashoggi is not a United States citizen

name:John Oliver

text:is that right it's a permanent resident
okay we don't like it John we don't like
it and we don't like it even a little
bit but as to whether or not we should
stop a hundred and ten billion dollars
from being spent in this country knowing

name:John Oliver

text:they have four or five alternatives two
very good alternatives that would not be
acceptable to pick he's openly
demonstrating to the entire world and to
Saudi Arabia specifically that arms deal
much more important than butchered

name:John Oliver

text:journalists look clearly giving Saudi
Arabia green lights for two solid years
has had consequences and a lot of people
now have some big decisions to make the
second annual Davos in the desert begins
nine days from now and already all of

name:John Oliver

text:these companies have pulled out although
as of right now Treasury secretary Steve
minuchin is still planning to attend
which is ridiculous the desert is
comfortably hot enough without that
smoke show am i right

name:John Oliver

text:am i right smoke shop right
you can get it that's a me face am
i right am i right on that yeah now as
for the WWE while they say they are
monitoring the situation they're
gigantic crown jewel event is still

name:John Oliver

text:scheduled for November meaning John Cena
could well be back there doing this
which I guess in this context would mean
you don't see these human rights abuses
right here as for the president again
look every US leader has chosen to make

name:John Oliver

text:compromises when it comes to Saudi
Arabia but Trump may well be the first
one who doesn't see it as a compromise
because he and NBS are similar in some
of the worst possible ways they both
love money they're both a product of

name:John Oliver

text:inherited wealth they both love self
promotion yet disdain the press and they
even both share a design aesthetic that
amounts to Elvis tries to remember what
Versailles looks like but can't and
Trump's intense bromance with NBS is bad

name:John Oliver

text:news because when you set no boundaries
on an oppressive regime they are always
going to ask themselves how much can we
get away with here and as we saw this
week the answer to that may well be
pretty much anything

name:John Oliver

text:you
good evening ever live good evening
everybody thank you for being here give
yourselves a round of applause for being

nothing less than a crisply

support such a worthy organization you
have a fantastic night planned for you
full of stories that by turns inspiring
funny heartbreaking and hopeful and then
after you've become drunk on alcohol and

name:John Oliver

money that's just a fact not let me be
clear about this not money for me
personally that would be kind of a dick
move and yes I do realize the fraught
implications of a straight cisgender

aware of that I'm well aware of the
landmines I'm trying to steer around but
for those of you who don't know me I am
NOT like you I am British yes that does

right let's just all acknowledge that
historically 200 years ago this would
have been a very different evening you'd
be getting less jokes from me and more
instructions as to what I expect you to

America for 11 years it's the ice my

love with America at a point where you
are not your best
this to put it mildly is not your finest
hour at the moment and loving America
right now falling in love with America

who is throwing up all over herself just
holding back her hair so stare there let
it out you've made a horrible decision
you can't make this mistake again in
four years otherwise the sympathy will

name:John Oliver

text:be less just just as I'm sure I've ever
told this story before just so you know
it's amazing how what you filming this
on your first that's the new worst thing
about doing any kind of performance
anywhere now people see they're going I

name:John Oliver

text:want to enjoy this but now it's not good
for me later would be better later and
smaller is how I like to imbibe for my
entertainment via the night the night
that Donald Trump was elected president
which is still an insane sentence to say

name:John Oliver

text:out loud I watched I watched the
election happened on TV and I was on my
own and I was it was not again to put it
extremely mildly it was not ideal I
couldn't quite believe it happen so I
thought I'll wait until he speaks and

name:John Oliver

text:whatever it was that 1:00 in the morning
so I can see it happen and that did not
make me feel any better and so after
that I felt it soak a hollow inside I
thought I need what can I do to cheer
myself up and because I feel like a kind

name:John Oliver

text:of emotional vacuum and so what I did I
swear this is true is I watched five
back-to-back episodes of RuPaul's Drag
Race and you know what it kind of helped
it was it was basically watching the
version of America that I wanted to live

name:John Oliver

text:in rather than watching the one that was
unfolding in front of history before
this evening begins I would like just to
talk briefly about the concept of priety
you're gonna have an amazing evening
there an amazing stories imagine dragons

name:John Oliver

text:are gonna blow your boots off it's going
to be fantastic
the concept of pride to me as a British
person is unfamiliar because I
personally have lived my life in a
constant state of repression and deep

name:John Oliver

text:deep shame but but pride is something
that I very much come to enjoy living
vicariously through marches and parades
and protests and to a lesser extent Lady
Gaga's Super Bowl performances which I'd
loved it I loved everything about that I

name:John Oliver

text:loved the fact she caught a ball and
jumped off the stage but I lost more
than anything was the fact apparently a
Super Bowl halftime show is 30 minutes
and normally their halftime is 15
minutes and I loved the idea of these

name:John Oliver

text:football trick plays trying to come back
onto the field saying no you wait till
Gaga is finished you watch oh she is not
fucking done you're no one she she's got
three more changes you wait Brady you
wait proprietor a word that is used a

name:John Oliver

text:lot in the LGBTQ community and rightly
so cos pride and your identities
inspirational for others especially in a
world that would still so often prefer
people to remain in the shadows and
tonight is an opportunity for all of us

name:John Oliver

text:to say loudly and firmly fuck that noise
so what exactly what what what inspires
me most about pride though is that that
although the civil rights of the LGBTQ
community are so consistently under
siege its members remain accepting

name:John Oliver

text:inclusive and open-hearted The Trevor
Project represents that spirit of
showing up for each other it stands for
love and trust and hope and support and
honesty and belonging The Trevor Project
provides all of those things to those

name:John Oliver

text:who need it most and who often don't
know who to ask for them these are
critical issues you know that we need to
make it known that help is out there it
is accessible it is real and it is
waiting for you on that one day in that

name:John Oliver

text:one dark moment when nothing else seems
Within Reach
and now if this were my HBO show right
now at this point to break up this
awkwardly serious moment I would
introduce a man in a llama costume

name:John Oliver

text:just you know to take the pointy edge
off the moment it doesn't have to be a
man any person with any gender identity
has the right to wear alarm a costume
holy shit sorry
it's another mine avoided that that the

name:John Oliver

text:work that The Trevor Project is doing is
of the noblest course there is nothing
more pure than telling someone that they
are not alone when they feel like no one
can possibly understand their pain the
prime target the prime target of the

name:John Oliver

text:project is young adults between the ages
of 13 and 24 and those years are hard on
everyone I ask you to take my word for
this as I cannot individually show
everyone here at my high school yearbook
all I'm saying is my teenage years were

name:John Oliver

text:not smooth but you probably assumed that
from you know this but it's a little
mean to laugh so knowing yes we had yeah
it was clear there are puberty there was
a hand-grenade about to go off on your
face sailing confidently through your

name:John Oliver

text:adolescence without challenge or empathy
is not how you become a comedian it's
how you become president of the United
States of America but the point is the
point is young people in the LGBTQ
community often have it especially tough

name:John Oliver

text:and that that is why we are here tonight
we are here to provide a spark of light
in the darkness we're here because we
know what it took for all of us to make
it through that impossible age and for
those LGBTQ kids their self-doubt is

name:John Oliver

text:even more nuanced because underneath the
teenage awkwardness and the glasses and
the bad haircuts and the acne and the
bad teeth and other things that let's
say I've hypothetically gone over
underneath all of that is a fear of

name:John Oliver

text:being rejected by family and community
because of who you are at your very core
now there is still there is still work
to be done there is still out there
that's right
there is still clearly work to be done

name:John Oliver

text:and we can help provide the resources to
ensure that every single kid in crisis
knows that their life matters that they
deserve a future and the preventing
their suicide doesn't just help them it
also prevents us from losing the love

name:John Oliver

text:and the art and the life that they have
to share
now the key quest the key question is
when you are lost who do you ask for
directions and the answer is someone who
has been there and so many of you in

name:John Oliver

text:this room tonight have been there you
know the way through and you can share
that with someone who simply cannot find
it so from the bottom of my heart thank
you for being here for caring for
helping for donating and for standing up

name:John Oliver

text:to be counted and thank you for
listening to an adult who looks like he
could still be bullied by teenagers
stand here and talk about it for a few
minutes no but this night is absolutely
not about me it is about the community

name:John Oliver

text:assembled to provide hope and support
for one another and for the young people
who are not here in this room thank you
for telling your stories and inspiring
others to live theirs thank you quite
simply for showing up and for keeping

name:John Oliver

text:the trevor project alive
that is as a as a comedian I am allergic
to sincerity that was not easy for me I
really wish there was someone in a llama
costume to cut through it so now I have
I have to announce the Trevor Project

name:John Oliver

text:family that is you please meet the
person celebrating his 20th hour that's
right our hour as brand new 20th hour
Wow this is the this 20 hours young as
executive director of The Trevor Project
a meet play liam8 happy 20th

name:John Oliver

text:journalists the heroes that we root for
in movies like all the President's Men
the great Muppet Caper and most recently
spotlight we gotta nail these scumbags
we gotta show people that nobody could
get away with this

name:John Oliver

text:not a priest or a cardinal a freakin
Pope
I remember spotlight actually won Best
Picture at the Oscars this year meaning
newspapers finally received the
recognition that we normally reserved

name:John Oliver

text:the subject of such importance as the
incredible bravery of real-life
Hollywood filmmakers the incredible
bravery of fictional Hollywood
filmmakers and the incredible bravery of
wanting to your daughter's friends

name:John Oliver

text:but but one of one of the things that
made spotlights so powerful is the
knowledge that the newspaper industry
today is in big trouble
papers have been closing and downsizing
for years and that affects all of us

name:John Oliver

text:even if you only get your news from
Facebook Google Twitter or Arianna
Huffington's blockwork Junction and book
excerpt Clearinghouse those places are
often just repackaging the work of
newspapers and it is not just websites

name:John Oliver

text:watch how often TV news ends up citing
print sources according to the Chicago
Tribune according to the Detroit Free
Press according to the San Francisco
Chronicle according to The Times
Picayune the Boston Globe the Orlando

name:John Oliver

text:Sentinel the Philadelphia Inquirer the
Pittsburgh tribune-review the Detroit
News and the Houston Chronicle reports
the Los Angeles Times reports The
Oklahoman reports The Hartford Courant
reports the Salt Lake Tribune reports

name:John Oliver

text:it's pretty obvious without newspapers
around to cite TV news would just be
Wolf Blitzer endlessly batting a ball of
yarn around and it is not just news
outlets stupid shows like ours lean
heavily on local papers in fact whenever

name:John Oliver

text:this show is mistakenly called
journalism it is a slap in the face to
the actual journalists whose work we
rely on I'll give you just one example
two years ago we ran a piece on state
lotteries and a not insignificant

name:John Oliver

text:portion of it was built on the work of
Harry Astaire a reporter at The
Oregonian here is a clip we used of him
talking about this series on camera Here
I am quoting one of his Oregonian
stories directly and Here I am doing it

name:John Oliver

text:again you probably didn't notice it at
the time because you were too fixated on
my balls choice of shiny gray tie we
check a dress shirt the ty says mafia
funeral the shirt says high school
debate tournament and the face says I am

name:John Oliver

text:not confident enough to carry this lock
off but but the point is we used a lot
of hairy steps work in that piece and
and we try to add new information to our
stories our researchers work incredibly
hard but the media is a food chain which

name:John Oliver

text:would fall apart without local
newspapers and the problem is print ads
are less popular than with advertisers
than they used to be and online ads
produce much less revenue I'll show you
between 2004 and 2014

name:John Oliver

text:newspapers gained two billion dollars in
online ad revenue unfortunately in that
same period they lost thirty billion
dollars in print revenue so that's like
finding a Lucky Penny on the sidewalk on
the same day your bank account is

name:John Oliver

text:drained by a 16 year old Belgian hacker
and this has led to cutbacks in
newsrooms again look at the Oregonian it
used to be a big moneymaker in fact in
1993 their editor talked about how proud
he was of its record of success I've

name:John Oliver

text:been at that paper more than 40 years
and every year I've been there I've seen
our staff increase I've seen our
salaries increase not a years gone by
that an employee at the Reunion
full-time employee has not been a

name:John Oliver

text:beneficiary of a raise now that level of
confidence is almost tempting fate
he's like a citizen of Pompeii saying
what I love about this city is how
volcano-proof it is not a year goes by
without us not having to have our

name:John Oliver

text:horrified reactions captured in Ash
forever
unfortunately the Oregonian circulation
has since dropped and in 2013 just as
hairiest EV was working on his lottery
series their parent company advanced

name:John Oliver

text:publications dropped a bombshell this
picture tweeted out from inside the
Oregonian shows staffers listening as
editor Peter Bhatia broke the news some
had feared the paper will split in two
stop seven-day-a-week Home Delivery and

name:John Oliver

text:lay off some employees this is an a
strategic move to really focus everybody
on what that digital
future is and what our digital products
and services can be it's true they
became a digital first company and

name:John Oliver

text:digital first sounds like a high school
euphemism for seductively sucking on a
finger I put my finger in his mouth we
totally got to digital first it was like
ooh but it was also like hot and that
that meant big changes a local weekly

name:John Oliver

text:the willamette week got their hands on a
PowerPoint presentation for the
Oregonian staff outlining the fact
reporters would be expected to meet a
quota of three blog posts a day and on
any post of substance they would have to

name:John Oliver

text:post the first comment and what better
way to win the trust of your readers
than posting first underneath your own
article those rules were widely
criticized and have since been relaxed
but extra digital demands being placed

name:John Oliver

text:on journalists is now common throughout
the industry just listen to Washington
Post editor Marty Baron who you might
remember as the guy Liev Schreiber
played in spotlight he describes his
concerns about the average workload

name:John Oliver

text:required of journalists they have to do
their traditional reporting they have
participate in social media they have to
produce a wire service that's available
24 hours a day they have to be
responsible for video you name it

name:John Oliver

text:they're involved they're involved in it
it's a lot to ask that's true and if
journalists are constantly required to
write edit shoot videos and tweet
mistakes are going to get made perhaps
that is how the Boston Globe wound up

name:John Oliver

text:tweeting following a shooting in
Tennessee that the FBI had invested
farted about 70 leaks clearly if they
had more time they would have written
hashtag investor farted because that's
how you drive the conversation hashtag

name:John Oliver

text:investor party
now now add the Oregonian and the
Oregonian those digital demands came
just as almost a quarter of the newsroom
was laid off and over time even more
staffers left the paper including State

name:John Oliver

text:House reporters a two-time Pulitzer
winner and Harry is Steph so his work
bolstered our lottery piece and now the
lack of his work has bolstered this
journalism piece so you can't say that
we don't use every part of the hairiest

name:John Oliver

text:EV but here is where it gets frightening
because while the Oregonian rebuilt its
Statehouse team other papers have been
forced to simply go without a study of
over 200 papers found between 2003 and
2014 their number of full-time State

name:John Oliver

text:House reporters declined by 35 percent
and that's not good because while there
are some great web outlets
some of which do cover local government
there aren't nearly enough to replace
what has been lost just listen to David

name:John Oliver

text:Simon who before creating the TV show
the wire worked for years at the
Baltimore Sun the day I run into a
Huffington Post reporter at a Baltimore
Zoning Board hearing is the day that I
will be confident that we've actually

name:John Oliver

text:reached some sort of equilibrium you
know there there's no glory in that kind
of journalism but that is the bedrock of
what keeps you know got the next 10 or
15 years in this country are going to be
a halcyon error for state and local

name:John Oliver

text:political corruption is gonna be one of
the great times to be a corrupt
politician well you know I I really envy
them I really do he's right because not
having reporters at government meetings
is like a teacher leaving her room of

name:John Oliver

text:seventh graders to supervise themselves
best-case scenario Brittany gets gum in
her hair worst case scenario you no
longer have a school
I look it is clearly smart for
newspapers to expand online but the

name:John Oliver

text:danger in doing that is the temptation
to gravitate toward whatever gets the
most clicks
which is why news organizations badly
need to have leaders who appreciate that
what's popular isn't always what's most

name:John Oliver

text:important but that is not always the
case look at Sam Zell a billionaire
investor and living garden gnome nine
nine years ago he took over the Tribune
Company which owns newspapers like the
LA Times the Orlando Sentinel and the

name:John Oliver

text:Chicago Tribune after acquiring the
company he spoke to the Sentinels
nervous staff outlining his vision and
listened to one particular exchange with
a journalist his his last two words are
perhaps the most illuminating 11 very

name:John Oliver

text:simple I want to make enough money so I
can afford you it's really that simple
okay you need to in effect help me by
being a journalist that focuses and what
our readers want and therefore generates
more revenue but what readers want a

name:John Oliver

text:puppy dogs II mean we also need to
inform the community sorry I'm sorry ah
I can't hug him you're you're giving me
the classic what I would call
journalistic arrogance of deciding that
puppies don't come hopefully they get to

name:John Oliver

text:the point where our revenue is so
significant that we can do puppies
interact okay
whoa Sam Zell just created an inspiring
new motto for the Sentinels masthead all
the puppy news that's fit to print and

name:John Oliver

text:maybe some Iraq news too if we can
afford it
q now now the good news is Zell no
longer owns the tribune company the bad
news is their latest attempt to balance
business pressures with journalistic

name:John Oliver

text:responsibility has not been
confidence-inspiring just this year its
publishing arm tribute publishing was
rebranded into something much much
stupider this is the future of
journalists this is the future of

name:John Oliver

text:content it doesn't get much better than
that if you care about media and
technology this is the place to be
Truong stands for attribute online
content yes trunk they have chosen to
call themselves trunk which sounds like

name:John Oliver

text:the noise and ejaculating elephant mates
or or more appropriately the sound of a
stack of print newspapers being thrown
into a dumpster and if you are wondering
how trunks business model will be
different get ready to have your minds

name:John Oliver

text:trunked one of the key ways we're going
to harness the power of our journalism
is to have a optimization group this
trunk team will work with all the local
markets to harness the power of our
local journalism feed it into a funnel

name:John Oliver

text:and then optimize it so that we reach
the biggest global audience possible
what did she just say they're going to
feed journalism into a funnel oh we're
just going to take content and simply
cram it down your throat like you're an

name:John Oliver

text:abused goose and the corresponding
visuals make even less sense what is
happening here it looks like a bunch of
digital sperm impregnating a trunk egg
filming but what seems at first like a
banal corporate rebranding speech

name:John Oliver

text:quickly goes off the rails with their
next big idea artificial intelligence is
going to allow journalists to do their
jobs more efficiently
finding the right photos the videos the
databases the things that you were

name:John Oliver

text:packaged your stories with right now
that's a manual effort with artificial
intelligence you can create a system
that automatically is doing that for you
ok ok ok putting aside the news robots I
would like to take a moment to break

name:John Oliver

text:down what may be the most meaningless
graphic ever created we take a look on
the left there is the phrase
reading habits but once those reading
habits undergo X they become increased
consumption

name:John Oliver

text:it almost feels like a test and the
first employee to raise their hand and
say that doesn't mean anything becomes
king of the news and look it is easy to
make fun of tronc I could happily do it
for another 20 minutes but the truth is

name:John Oliver

text:publishers are desperate no one seems to
have a perfect plan to keep newspapers
afloat
one option seems to be to pray you get
bought by a billionaire benefactor who
could afford to swallow losses Amazon

name:John Oliver

text:founder Jeff Bezos bought The Washington
Post in 2013 and since then they've done
some spectacular journalism and the
reporters seem pretty happy despite some
of his stupider ideas like and this is
true a game that would allow a reader

name:John Oliver

text:who didn't enjoy an article to pay to
remove its vowels which is just absurd
taking out all the vowels makes every
word sound like the name of an app I'll
give you an example Turkey is a nation
in crisis Turk is a dating service that

name:John Oliver

text:helps you long-haul truckers but but
there are potential downsides to having
a rich owner especially if there is a
concern that they could meddle with the
papers coverage just look at what
happened to the Las Vegas review-journal

name:John Oliver

text:last year it was acquired by Sheldon
Adelson at the billionaire casino
magnate and Republican mega donor he's a
big deal in Vegas and his businesses are
at the center of a lot of stories the
reviewed journal covers but while

name:John Oliver

text:Adelson and the papers editors have
strongly denied that he interferes with
news coverage in any way the editors
have admitted that they put any articles
about him or his business through a
special review process to make sure that

name:John Oliver

text:they are fair although listen to an ex
deputy deputy editor describe his
experience of that process in this
review process things are changed things
are added things are removed there's no
explanation for why and there's no

name:John Oliver

text:appeal more than once reporters have
asked if they could have their name
taken off the story and have been told
no that's not allowed anymore there are
things that are done because it's known
that this is the way Sheldon Adelson

name:John Oliver

text:wants it to read and it can be something
very minor or it can be something very
very big
now if that's true that is very
compromising there could not be a worse
owner of a paper in Vegas than Sheldon

name:John Oliver

text:Adelson with the possible exception of
cirque de soleil because they wouldn't
even give you a newspaper you just have
a fistful of glitter
thrown in your face by a 90-pound man in
a thong and and look look none of this

name:John Oliver

text:is to say that there aren't people
producing great work in local news rooms
right now many are at the Oregonian at
the review-journal
even at trunk but they are doing
it despite their current conditions and

name:John Oliver

text:the truth is a big part of the blame for
this industry's dire straits is on us
and our unwillingness to pay for the
work journalists produce we've just
grown accustomed to getting unused for
free and the longer that we get

name:John Oliver

text:something for free the less willing we
are to pay for it and I'm talking to you
the person watching this segment on
YouTube using the Wi-Fi from the coffee
shop underneath your apartments killing
us

name:John Oliver

text:so later we are either going to have to
pay for journalism or we are all going
to pay for it because if we don't
not only will malfeasance run amok but
the journalism movies of the future are
going to look a lot more like this in a

name:John Oliver

text:city built on secrets I'm hearing
there's corruption in City Hall
only a newsroom willing to stop at
nothing can uncover the truth and might
go all the way to the top all the way to
the top a new and I think we could prove

name:John Oliver

text:that they knew
yeah I'm just not sure what can I clicks
we're gonna get on that you know anybody
else I've got a thing about a cat that
looks like a raccoon or it could be a
raccoon it looks like a cat wait I'm not

name:John Oliver

text:sure now we're talking yeah yeah yeah
yeah that's great let's figure that out
all right yeah maybe an online poll it's
political corruption in Boston we'll
come back to that if we have time but I

text:have sex with another McDonald's mascot
new genetics are too similar and their
kids always turn out winners
very very weird incidentally it's not
like gritty has any business being a
hockey mascot apparently he hasn't

took an odd turn like when the
prosecutor to whom the Republicans had
outsourced their responsibilities seized
on a polygraph test that Ford had passed
did you pay for the polygraph yourself I

name:John Oliver

text:don't think so okay do you know who did
pay for the polygraph not yet no I
believe you said it hasn't been paid for
yet is that correct
let me put an end to this mystery her
lawyers have paid for her polygraph

name:John Oliver

text:as his routine as his routine don't you
try and brush her question aside she
just cracked this case wide open
she found the missing piece of the
puzzle specifically a puzzle that reads
who cares thoughts testimony was

name:John Oliver

text:brave and compelling and seemed to
affect many on the committee including
Republican senator Orrin Hatch who chose
to express his admiration in a far from
ideal way and he found dr. Ford credible
pleasing you should not use the word

name:John Oliver

text:pleasing to describe a sexual assault
survivor painfully recounting one of the
worst moments of her life you honestly
shouldn't really use it to describe
anything maybe maybe watching milk mix
into your coffee except you know what

name:John Oliver

text:not even then because the moment you say
watching this milk is pleasing you come
off like a creep who's waiting for
everyone to leave the room so he can
 his coffee the point is by
lunchtime on Thursday it honestly seemed

name:John Oliver

text:that Cavanaugh's nomination could be
finished even Fox News was implying as
much this was extremely emotional
extremely raw and extremely credible and
nobody could listen to her deliver those
words and talk about the assault and the

name:John Oliver

text:impact it had had on his life in her
life and not have the her heart go your
heart go out to her this is a disaster
for the Republicans that is Fox News
calling Ford's testimony a disaster for
the Republicans and not like one of

name:John Oliver

text:those Puerto Rico disasters you know
this time one they might actually care
about but then
then came Cavanaugh testimony and it is
worth looking at it in detail tonight
because in every regard it could not

name:John Oliver

text:have been more different from fours a
for starters while she was remarkably
composed in discussing traumatic details
Cavanaugh came straight out of the gates
weird in his opening statement not just
denying all her allegations but almost

name:John Oliver

text:breaking down while attempting to paint
a folksy image of his time in high
school I worked out with other guys at
Toby's house he was the great
quarterback on our football team and his
dad ran workouts yeah he's crying at the

name:John Oliver

text:memory of lifting weights at his friend
Tobin's house I hate to say it but I'm
starting to think that men might be too
emotional for the super alien corpse
he'd be really pretty if he just smiled
more and it wasn't just memories of a

name:John Oliver

text:high school quarterback that was making
him tear up I've always had a lot of
close female friends I remember talking
almost every night it seemed to my
friends ami or Julie or Kristen for
Karen

name:John Oliver

text:the Suzanne or Maura or Megan or Nikki
the list goes on okay
that's not testimony though is it that
is a plaintive spoken word cover of
Mambo number five
ramallah sandra and rita and as i

name:John Oliver

text:continue you know they're getting
sweeter but when Cavanaugh was not
choking back to use he was starting to
get noticeably angry arguing that he was
the victim of a giant conspiracy this
allegation was Unleashed and publicly

name:John Oliver

text:deployed over dr. Ford's wishes and then
and then as no doubt was expected if not
planned came a long series of false
last-minute smears designed to scare me
and drive me out of the process before
any hearing occurred crazy stuff gangs

name:John Oliver

text:illegitimate children fights on boats in
Rhode Island I mean come on do I seem
like exactly the type of person who
would get into a fight on a boat in
Rhode Island
seriously you tell me when you picture a

name:John Oliver

text:fight on a boat in Rhode Island
do you just picture two of me yelling at
each other and exactly this pitch and
volume is that what you say but if you
wanted my hair cut you would tell your
father to give you the fight on a boat

name:John Oliver

text:in Rhode Island I would like to see you
say that to my face on a boat in Rhode
Island and that's all I have to shout
about that you
[Applause]
remember what you've just seen was him

name:John Oliver

text:reading from a prepared statement it got
even stranger once he started taking
questions did you consume alcohol during
your high school years yes we drank beer
my friends and I the boys and girls yes
we drank the air

name:John Oliver

text:I liked beer still liked beer we drank
beer the drinking age as I know it was
18 so the seniors were legal senior year
in high school people were illegal to
drink and we drink yeah we drank beer
and I said sometimes sometimes probably

name:John Oliver

text:had too many beers and sometimes other
people had too many beers
we drank beer we liked beer yeah I get
that I do I am I get that loud and clear
Bret's but but the question isn't really
do you like beer is it it's how much do

name:John Oliver

text:you like it just like how the question
in Jeffrey Dahmer's trial wasn't do you
like people it was do you like people to
a really problematic extent and when
pressed on his drinking Kavanagh became
either dismissive or outright hostile

name:John Oliver

text:and it was at those moments you got a
real sense of who this man actually is
what do you consider to be too many
beers I don't know you know we whatever
the chart says I like beer I don't know
if you like beer senator um what do you

name:John Oliver

text:like the next one is Senator what are
you oh you're saying there's never been
a case where you drank so much that you
didn't remember what happened the night
before or part of what happened that's
you're asking about yeah blackout I

name:John Oliver

text:don't know have you
could you answer the question judge I
just so you that's not happened is that
your answer
yeah and I'm curious if you have okay so
first aside from being deeply

name:John Oliver

text:disrespectful have you is just dot the
answer of an innocent person if you ask
someone if they ever blew a dog and they
go I don't know of you that person blew
a dog he blew a dog in in all
likelihood not just one either and that

name:John Oliver

text:surly tone was emblematic of Cavanaugh's
demeanor throughout the hearing not the
tone of a man who hopes to one day have
the honor of serving on the Supreme
Court but the tone of someone who feels
entitled to be honest and frankly can't

name:John Oliver

text:believe that you're being such a dick
about this and that actually does make
some sense because this is a man who has
had every imaginable advantage his elite
high school and this is true has its own
nine hole golf course now am i saying

name:John Oliver

text:that someone who went to a school with
its own golf course should not be on the
Supreme Court yeah yeah I think I am but
here we are I'm gonna stand by it but
the catalogue didn't just rely on
belligerence to refute Ford's charges he

name:John Oliver

text:brought evidence specifically a calendar
from 1982
about which he was and I know this will
shock you weirdly emotional why did I
keep calendars my dad started to keeping
detailed calendars of his life in 1978

name:John Oliver

text:he did so is both a calendar and a diary
Christmastime we sit around and he ails
us with old stories old milestones or
weddings old events from his calendars I
know that it may seem cruel to make fun
of a man crying over his late father's

name:John Oliver

text:calendars but what if I were to tell you
that his father is still alive
and was sitting right behind him and
that is why I am now completely
comfortable saying that every Christmas
we'd gather round and dad would

name:John Oliver

text:regardless with old events from his
calendar is the single weirdest
thing I've ever heard anybody say
Cavanaugh Jeb said his dad started
keeping calendars in 1978 when Cavanaugh
was 13 meaning he would have been 14 at

name:John Oliver

text:the time his dad had even a single
calendar to read to his children fraud
and an adult man reading last year's
calendar to his 14 year old son is
literally the saddest Christmas I could
imagine other than being one of the

name:John Oliver

text:innocent people who gets murdered in the
movie die heart that is literally the
only other example and the truth is
Cavanaugh's calendar may not have
actually helped him because while he
told the panel he never attended a

name:John Oliver

text:gathering like the one dr. Ford
describes in her allegation in fact his
calendar shows at least one similar
events with at least two of the people
Ford named in her letter and Cavanaugh
misrepresenting the truth actually

name:John Oliver

text:became something of a really troubling
pattern for instance he repeatedly made
this strong claim to poke holes in Ford
story I just want to emphasize all four
witnesses who are allegedly at the event
have said it didn't happen including dr.

name:John Oliver

text:Ford's longtime friend miss Kaiser
except this 53 year old frat pledge is
actually significantly mistaking the
facts there because in reality three of
those people merely said that they
didn't recall the party as described and

name:John Oliver

text:Ford's friend miss Kaiser did
specifically say she believes Ford's
allegation and the fourth person there
is Cavanaugh himself so Cavanaugh just
wildly mischaracterized evidence and
that is one thing a judge really

name:John Oliver

text:no not to do is basically that and don't
tuck your robes into your blue jeans
because it's objectively a bad look then
there no was the fact that for all of
cabin last talk of his wholesome teenage
years spent respecting women for their

name:John Oliver

text:friendships and doing sick reps and
Tobin's dad's house his high school
yearbook tells a very different story
for instance he and his bro friends brag
about be Renata alumni referring to a
girl that they knew now Kavanagh claims

name:John Oliver

text:that that was completely asexual and
just clumsily intended to show affection
and that this she was one of us which is
a little hard to believe given that a
Renata only just found out about it and
said the insinuation is horrible hurtful

name:John Oliver

text:and simply untrue and P if it was just
affection for a friend where's the
Alumni Society for Amy or Julie or
Kristen or Karen or more especially
[Applause]
Cavanaugh had similarly implausible

name:John Oliver

text:explanations for other terms in the
yearbook specifically those commonly
associated with drinking or sex have you
I don't know if it's buffed or boofed
how do you pronounce that Jai refers to
flatulence we were 16 let's look at

name:John Oliver

text:beach week Ralph's Club biggest
contributor what does the word Ralph
mean in that that probably refers to
throwing up I'm known to have a weak
stomach and I always have devil's
triangle drinking game the term

name:John Oliver

text:devil's triangle is commonly known to
refer to a threesome involving two men
and one woman so I'm just not buying
that unless all your drinking games were
named after widely recognized sex acts
Oh doggy style

name:John Oliver

text:drinking game you pour vodka in a bowl
and you lap it up while wearing only a
dog collar a fist thing drinking game
that's gripping a Shiraz in each fist
and toasting the progress of feminism
sixty-nining absolutely drinking game

name:John Oliver

text:that's listening to Bryan Adams hit song
summer of 69 while uneventfully drinking
a beer on the porch even c-span callers
we're not buying this whole drinking
game defense
go ahead Carl hi I just wanted to echo a

name:John Oliver

text:few things that another color said which
is that a devil's triangle is certainly
not a drinking game it's an encounter
with two men and a woman bloody well go
next to Mary in Bronxville New York I
like to imagine that that guy calls in

name:John Oliver

text:every day to describe what a Devil's
Triangle is and that was the only day he
stood even a chance of getting all the
way through his explanation well it may
seem unbelievably petty to give this
much attention to our high schoolers

name:John Oliver

text:yearbook you have to remember that to
some extent many were watching this
hearing to try and ascertain who was
more trustworthy was it the terrified
psychology professor who blew up her
entire life to relive her trauma on a

name:John Oliver

text:national stage or was it
Judge animal house who seemed to be
sweating making up drinking games before
members of the Senate and yet for some
senators cavernous poor performance was
completely immaterial as they had

name:John Oliver

text:already made up their mind Orrin Hatch
taking a break from being pleased made
the broad case that it was ridiculous to
even ask questions about an events that
took place such a long time ago
this is a national disgrace the way

name:John Oliver

text:you're being treated
there's been no whisper of misconduct by
him at a time he's been a judge what we
have are uncorroborated unsubstantiated
claims from his teenage years now that
is clearly a shitty disingenuous

name:John Oliver

text:argument though although I will give
hatch credit for invoking the phrase
teenage years with the voice of a
thirteen-year-old whose balls are
literally dropping mid-sentence now as
for Lindsey Graham he turned his

name:John Oliver

text:performative disgust at the process up
to 10 this is the most unethical sham
since I've been in politics and if you
really wanted to know the truth you sure
as hell wouldn't have done what you've
done to this guy

name:John Oliver

text:you're looking for a fair process you
came to the wrong town at the wrong time
my friend okay first of all Lindsey
Graham sounds like the least
intimidating sheriff in the entire Wild
West you turned back around and get back

name:John Oliver

text:on your horse mr. meyen is what you're
looking at is the soft tender little
baby face of justice you came to the
wrong town at the wrong get on your
horse look second Lindsey Graham is not
actually wrong there he looks like a dog

name:John Oliver

text:that's not allowed to be within 50 feet
of a playground but he is not
technically wrong this process was
deeply flawed but that is because he and
the Republican majority designed it that
way if they wanted to avoid a he-said

name:John Oliver

text:she-said situation they absolutely could
have but it said they only called two
people so we only heard what he said and
what she said a much fairer process
would have involved gathering evidence
and hearing from others like Cavanaugh's

name:John Oliver

text:classmates in particular his high school
friend mark judge who forged says was in
the room during the alleged assault but
that is not how Republicans chose to set
up the hearing and fall Cavanaugh's
emotional appeals about wanting his name

name:John Oliver

text:cleared he was repeatedly asked about
whether he supported an FBI
investigation and he consistently dodged
the question judge Cavanaugh will you
support an FBI investigation right now I
I will do whatever the committee wants

name:John Oliver

text:to personally do you think that's the
best thing for us to do you won't answer
look senator I've said I wanted a
hearing and I'd said I was welcome
anything you'll welcome
anything just say you will support an

name:John Oliver

text:investigation you've been accused of a
heinous crime that you insist you did
not commit if I will Cavanaugh I would
be desperately trying to prove my
innocence in every possible way FBI
investigations polygraph tests sworn

name:John Oliver

text:affidavits from not only mark judge but
also all my other boys from g-town prep
I'm talking about Tobin Timmy squee PJ
come rug Chuck smirk C dubs dirty Pete
fat Andy Swift of the home dog beau
nowit's boner which his older brother

name:John Oliver

text:j-money and dick you know you know
character witnesses look at this point
let's actually pull back and look at the
picture of Cavanaugh's character that we
now have because even if you don't think
he's guilty of sexual assault or even if

name:John Oliver

text:you think that it's impossible to say
whether he is because it happened in his
teenage years even then there should be
plenty in what we saw this week - cause
you real concern because a key part of
the job that he is up for is judgment

name:John Oliver

text:and temperament and this week we saw
Cavanaugh talk over the top of senators
dodged questions and conflate doesn't
recall something happening with denies
something happened which is again a
 important distinction for a

name:John Oliver

text:judge not to mention he repeatedly wept
at the concept of calendars and there
was one more important moment that I
would argue is disqualifying in and of
itself because ideally a Supreme Court
justice should make decisions

name:John Oliver

text:independent of politics Kavanagh himself
has stated the court must never be
viewed as a part as an institution and
he is right about that and yet in his
opening statement a document he had time
to draft and consider his tone was

name:John Oliver

text:positively trumpian this whole two-week
effort has been a calculated and
orchestrated political hit fueled with a
parent pent-up anger about President
Trump and the 2016 election fear that
has been unfairly stoked about my

name:John Oliver

text:judicial record revenge on behalf of the
Clintons and millions of dollars in
money from outside left-wing opposition
groups now that is absolutely horrifying
and it is worth taking him home right
now to note the norm that has just been

name:John Oliver

text:shattered because I know that we're all
basically calloused so people talking
that way now but we are supposed to have
at least nine people left in America who
do not talk that way and yet Cavanaugh
just all but came out and said that he's

name:John Oliver

text:going to approach his entire tenure as
one giant case of me versus the
Lib tard Cox
and this this brings me to the most
basic question that remains why why this
particular asshole what is he the hill

name:John Oliver

text:that conservatives are willing to die on
and I do know that for some of
Cavanaugh's most ardent supporters this
is a purely ideological issue senators
may not say it out loud but this woman
for Cavanaugh did being a gets in

name:John Oliver

text:personally as I went abortion to stop
even if it turns out he's guilty I think
I'm still gonna support him and I hope
he gets in because this could be a good
chance to overturn abortion okay so it's
fine it's fine to appoint someone who

name:John Oliver

text:has committed sexual assault to the
Supreme Court as long as they will
curtail abortion rights it's a starts
that prioritizes human lives as long as
you think life begins at conception
stops right before a sexual assault and

name:John Oliver

text:then starts right back up again
as soon as that assault is over now
obviously obviously I personally do not
agree with that
but even if ending legal abortion is
your ultimate goal

name:John Oliver

text:there are many conservative judges who
could deliver that to you without all of
Cavanaugh's issues because purely as a
judge there is nothing unique about
Kavanagh nothing he's not uniquely
qualified Trump reportedly picked him

name:John Oliver

text:from a list of 25 names provided by
outside groups like The Federalist
Society whose executive vice president
explicitly pointed out he had no
preference regarding the list is there a
leading contender for you no there's not

name:John Oliver

text:really not no it's the list is really
good they're not in order
you're just saying no no no you can
throw a dart at that list and in my view
you'd be fine Wow he answered that
question about Supreme Court justices

name:John Oliver

text:like he was just asked which pickle in a
jar
it's his favorite pickle I don't know
man they're all pickles it's a pickle
jar so if it's in this jar it's a
 pic

name:John Oliver

text:but for some reason the Republican
leadership is continuing to push Cavan
our heart in fact on Friday Lindsey
Graham seem to view Kavanagh with even
more relish I've never felt better
about him being on the bench than I do

name:John Oliver

text:right now really you feel better now
than before Cavanaugh testified do you
really mean that or are you afraid that
if you don't say it cabin art will
challenge you to a fight on a boat in
Rhode Island because I do get that he

name:John Oliver

text:seems like the type the point is after
all of this I genuinely cannot see a
single good reason for pushing Cavanaugh
over a replacement candidate because you
know deep down any judge they choose is
almost certainly going to restrict

name:John Oliver

text:abortion rights you don't need to choose
an unhinged partisan with multiple
accusations of sexual misconduct hanging
over him so it feels like they're doing
this just to deliver a you to
Democrats and even more directly a

name:John Oliver

text:you to women because when this when this
week began the biggest fear for many was
that the committee would not believe
Christine Blasi Ford but by the time the
week ended it seemed that something
darker might have happened because it

name:John Oliver

text:seemed that response was oh we believe
you we just don't care and the tragic
thing is she knew this was a possibility
she said so explicitly during her
testimony once he was selected and it
seemed like he was popular and that was

name:John Oliver

text:a sure vote I was calculating daily the
the risk benefit for me of coming
forward and wondering whether I would
just be jumping in front of a train that
was headed to where it was headed anyway
and that I would just be personally

name:John Oliver

text:annihilated she knew publicly reliving
the most traumatic event of her life
could have absolutely no effect on
anything and yet she spoke up anyway it
is absolutely incredible the lengths
that some people will go to for a free

name:John Oliver

text:polygraph test look
look look here's the thing here's the
thing I am I am not saying that this is
a done deal just yet they were
desperately pushing Cavanaugh through on
Friday only for extraordinary pressure

name:John Oliver

text:to force the reopening of the FBI
investigation which by the way may well
end up being so limited as to be
essentially pointless but the fact is
only continued pressure has even the
slightest chance of stopping Cavanaugh's

name:John Oliver

text:confirmation and if he does as seems
increasingly likely make his way to the
court we should never forget how that
happened all what he represents we
certainly will not forget it on this
show you may know that for years we've

name:John Oliver

text:had an all dog Supreme Court with dogs
playing the justices from Samuel Alito
to Ruth Bader Ginsburg right good dog
good dog dunk die good dog good dog
sit sit and don't die now now now since
2017 it's actually been a mostly dog

name:John Oliver

text:Supreme Court because kneel course hich
is represented on it's by a lobster and
that's because his seat was stolen from
Merrick Garland's there for like a
lobster he does not belong there but
Cavanaugh Cavanaugh if he is seated

name:John Oliver

text:doesn't even deserve that treatment he
deserves something that constantly
reminds people who he is something
hostile consistently UPS unsettling
temperamentally unpleasant and that
screams who the allowed this to

name:John Oliver

text:happen so I pray that we will not have
to use this but if we do I see no more
fitting embodiment of Cavanaugh than
this
[Music]
yes that's right

name:John Oliver

text:just actual Supreme Court
have to deal with Cavanaugh animal
Supreme Court should not have to deal
with this new tainted carpet swatch that
appears to be tweaking on bath socks
I truly hope it does not come to this

name:John Oliver

text:and look there is still a chance that we
can stop it so please call your senators
tomorrow and tell them you do not want
to be looking at this for the next 30
years 10 off the bench
you're not even confirmed yet no I don't

I don't want to be in your big weirdo
get off that bench - entitled monster

our main story tonight concerns Facebook

name:John Oliver

text:the worst place to wish happy birthday
to a friend other than a funeral now
Facebook has been in the news a lot
recently over concerns about everything
from privacy to fake news to Russian
trolls but tonight we're actually going

name:John Oliver

text:to go in a different direction and focus
on his behavior overseas because
Facebook has been expanding aggressively
abroad more than half its revenue come
from outside the US and eighty percent
of its users now live in foreign

name:John Oliver

text:countries posting things like this yes
that is that's an international version
of the in my feelings challenge the
thing that took Facebook and Instagram
by storm after being popularized by the
Shiggy show and you can learn more about

name:John Oliver

text:all of that in my new book I don't know
what any of these words mean but my
staff assures me it makes sense for
years Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg
pushed his utopian idea that all
connections are good connections with

name:John Oliver

text:feel-good ads showing him bringing the
Internet to the world and Facebook
employees proudly saying things like
this by connecting the world people
realize that there are other people in
the world who have different lives in

name:John Oliver

text:them and that maybe their lives could be
better and then amazing things happen
you want to do something big and you
have this access to you know 1.2 billion
people what can you do is just limited
by your imagination look connecting

name:John Oliver

text:billions of people does sound great but
it's also important to remember that
when it comes to the Internet a certain
number of those people are then going to
say Jews control sharks who did 9/11 and
you really have to think that through

name:John Oliver

text:unfortunately thinking things through
has never really been Facebook strong
point there early motto was famously
move fast and break things a sentiment
which Zuckerberg has explained this way
we want to build our culture and our

name:John Oliver

text:infrastructure so that we just try to
move you know one or two clicks faster
than than other companies and you know
sometimes we go too fast and we mess up
a bunch of stuff and then we have to fix
it and that's cool is that cool is that

name:John Oliver

text:cool at all mark because that seems like
maybe the most reckless corporate motto
since the hindenburg companies fly fast
and smokes
and a big bag of hydrogen how did you
not foresee the problems that were

name:John Oliver

text:heading your way and make no mistake
Facebook has broken things overseas
sometimes they were small for instance
over the summer there was an earthquake
in Indonesia and while Facebook
undeniably connected people there it

name:John Oliver

text:wasn't necessarily in the way the
situation demanded as this international
news report shows normally Facebook
sends the balloon and the confetti
animations to users wishing each other
well

name:John Oliver

text:however the Indonesian work for
congratulations selamat can also mean
unheard or to survive so when Facebook
users posted messages saying I hope
people will survive Facebook give them
celebratory animations yeah

name:John Oliver

text:that's not ideal is it because there's a
time and a place for balloons and it's
very rarely after the word survived in
fact let me prove that to you
I have some terrible news we may have to
eat each other to survive no no that's

name:John Oliver

text:the worst time for that and look look if
if embarrassing mistranslations were the
only problems that Facebook had that
would be one thing but the company has
made some hugely consequential mistakes
overseas and that is what tonight's

name:John Oliver

text:story is about in the Philippines and
Cambodia Facebook has been accused of
empowering authoritarians in Sri Lanka
India and Indonesia viral rumors and
hateful comments on Facebook have been
linked to outbreaks of deadly violence

name:John Oliver

text:but for the worst distillation of what
Facebook can do to a country just look
at Myanmar the country who thinks so
little about you didn't even realize
that's not Myanmar that's Mikhail
Gorbachev's birthmark

name:John Oliver

text:this is Myanmar now Myanmar
also known as Burma was for decades cut
off from the world under military
dictatorships but in recent years as its
transition to a quasi civilian
government internet use there especially

name:John Oliver

text:a Facebook has exploded in 2013 just
over 1 percent of citizens had internet
access but now 18 million people are on
Facebook thanks in part to becoming
pre-installed on mobile phones and heavy
promotion by service providers who

name:John Oliver

text:didn't charge Facebook usage against
data plans yeah we can use Facebook for
free except for looking at photos and
watching videos everything is free we'll
use Facebook for free and ask the things
we want to know I'll use empty tea and

name:John Oliver

text:post everything to Facebook it's free
let's use Facebook for free with MPC ok
just quick question is Facebook free cuz
I'm worried that commercial didn't quite
make it clear so with Facebook's so easy
to access it basically became the

name:John Oliver

text:internet so much so that people in
Myanmar use the terms internet and
Facebook interchangeably and look some
people there use Facebook for fun that
guy you saw earlier lives in Myanmar
while other people find it to be a

name:John Oliver

text:complete waste of time like this
irritating teacher everybody said easy
it's my phone playing games I hate I
hate I don't like it's a terrible look
likes boys Facebook is a toilet
find it okay I get that he's annoyed but

name:John Oliver

text:calling Facebook a toilet is a little
unfair to toilets because they make
go away whereas Facebook retains
disseminate to your acquaintances
and reminds you of from seven years
ago or what allow the corporation's to

name:John Oliver

text:put their in front of you what I'm
saying is there is a purity and
integrity to toilets that Facebook
seriously lacks but Facebook's issues in
Myanmar go well beyond distracted
teenagers because if you have glanced at

name:John Oliver

text:the not Trump section of the newspaper
at all recently you are probably aware

is a big but by all accounts Facebook
absolutely did inflamed pre-existing

Myanmar prepared by independent UN
investigators said Facebook has been a

spread hate and it is weird to hear
something that started out as frivolous
be described like that it's like if five
years from now you and investigators
called bubble tea and aggressive threat

honestly I never really liked it but
Jesus Christ
but hate speech against Muslims and
especially the row hinge er flourished
on Facebook posted by military leaders

want to take over the whole country that

right a Buddhist monk is known as the
Burmese bin Laden which is as jarring as
if you found out there's a Care Bear
known as the one who because to be
honest I always thought wish bear would

that Beth Fox
lerato had hundreds of thousands of
followers on Facebook and he uses pages
to wreak havoc including spreading false
accusations that a Muslim business owner

that helped instigate riots in the city
of mandalay in 2014 in which two people
were killed and around 20 others injured
and yet despite repeated warnings about
where our to facebook didn't get around

and that is just one example of the
extent to which facebook became an echo
chamber of Islamophobia one local
official told reporters he was proud to
oversee a Muslim free village even

name:John Oliver

text:though he admitted he had never even met
a Muslim before adding I have to thank
Facebook because it is giving me the
true information in Myanmar and here is
what happened when ABC talked to people
in the streets there most local people

name:John Oliver

text:here get their news via Facebook and
judging by what people have told us they
are not getting the whole picture what
do you think about the
I think they are terrorists they are
extra they're making problems everything

name:John Oliver

text:I could gather information from Facebook
what does Facebook say they want to
occupy our land and our people that is
very very dangerous because no one
should be judged by the worst things
people say about them on Facebook if I

name:John Oliver

cuck twit a prime example of why
abortion should be more readily
available and that I look like a
distressed bird in a pet shop trying
desperately to get your attention and I

name:John Oliver

text:ask you is any of that apart from that
last one really fair I would say no I
would argue not so so how the did
so much hate speech and violence
inciting content stay up for so long
because it's not like Facebook doesn't

name:John Oliver

text:have rules they have a lot of them their
own internal materials get into details
like which sort of anuses photoshopped
onto faces they're willing to allow this
is true they even cite graphic examples
such as this image of Trump with an anus

name:John Oliver

text:for a mouth that is apparently allowed
by the way because he is a public figure
Taylor Swift with anuses for eyes also
allowed for the same reason but this
image of kim jeong-hoon with an anus for
a mouth is apparently not okay because i

name:John Oliver

text:quote it also displays a sex toy
inserted into the anus but that still
leaves gray areas doesn't it for
instance what if I display a meatball
sub being inserted into that same mouth
anus is a meatball sub a sex toy could

name:John Oliver

anal beads of Italy and by the way Olive
Garden that slogan is free for you to
use
look you can have it it's yours look you
can quibble you can absolutely quibble

name:John Oliver

text:with where Facebook draws its lines and
the broader discussion of private
companies policing speech is an
important one but the point is Facebook
does have standards that are enforced in
a number of ways they have artificial

name:John Oliver

text:intelligence that automatically detects
some objectionable content and removes
it they also rely on users like you and
me to flag objectionable content which
is then reviewed by human moderators
it's something most social media

name:John Oliver

text:companies do and it is a thankless job
as you can see from this training
session run by a Content moderation
company in India here the person is not
naked but you can see their exxor shape
is visible now this lady's now here it's

name:John Oliver

text:very much obvious that intensely sees
focusing on but part the camera is
focusing on but part it will fall under
nudity it's not proper nudity but it
will fall under nudity I'm sorry I'm
absolutely calling it that guy is

name:John Oliver

text:definitely focusing on the buttocks but
as Facebook themselves will tell you
policing nudity is the easy part what's
harder is defining and spotting
misinformation hate speech and that is
what Myanmar has been drowning in and

name:John Oliver

text:Facebook system failed them at every
stage first their a I didn't work
because Facebook's technology isn't
compatible with me amaz language fonts
which you know not great but fine that
just meant that they badly needed

name:John Oliver

text:Burmese people to flag content for them
but to do that it really might have
helped if things like their community
standards and reporting systems had been
in Burmese which they weren't until late
2015 which isn't great in the country

name:John Oliver

text:where almost no one speaks English just
imagine if Facebook Facebook's interface
here was in Burmese you would have no
way of knowing which button did what in
fact that's not even Facebook's
interface that's just a list of

name:John Oliver

text:dinosaurs ranked from most to least
 and by the way
Stegosaurus is way too far down on that
list
Stella Soros is basically the wish bear
of dinosaurs seriously

name:John Oliver

text:that bear can get it but but wait wait
because it gets worse even content that
did get flagged in Myanmar often didn't
get taken down and one reason with that
may be that Facebook had shockingly few
Burmese speaking content reviewers how

name:John Oliver

text:many you know I'll just let this Reuters
reporter tell you back in 2014 they had
one person they hired a second in early
2015 they out sourced an operation
they'd been doing that for a while but
they had had no burmese speakers at all

name:John Oliver

text:until 2015 when they hired - it's true
first they had one then they doubled it
to two and through outsourcing added two
more so full and I don't know what the
exact right number of Burmese speakers
for Facebook is but it probably

name:John Oliver

text:shouldn't be possible for the sum total
of them to be decimated in a tandem bike
accident and it's not like Facebook can
plead ignorance or surprise about any of
this multiple civil society groups and
individuals try to warn them as far back

name:John Oliver

text:as 2013 five years ago that they face
trouble in Myanmar and Facebook itself
now admits that they move too slowly
though Zuckerberg insists that they're
now making progress they've hired 60
burmese speakers me recently told

name:John Oliver

text:members of congress that they're looking
for more we're hiring dozens of more
Burmese language content reviewers
because hate speech is very language
specific it's hard to do it without
people who speak the local language and

name:John Oliver

text:we need to ramp up our effort there
dramatically hate speech is language
specific it's a little weird to hear a
guy who's been universally lauded as a
genius and a visionary say something
that's completely obvious as if it's a

name:John Oliver

text:brand new idea to him it's as if Steve
Jobs called everyone together for his
brand new discovery mrs. Doubtfire was
just the dad in a costume yeah we know
Steve
did you not get that I thought you were

name:John Oliver

text:smart I don't trust my iPhone now but
for all his reassuring words many argue
that Zuckerberg still hasn't done nearly
enough hate speech is still widespread
on Facebook in Myanmar last month four
months after Zuckerberg promised to do

name:John Oliver

text:better
Reuters found more than a thousand
Burmese language posts attacking the row
hinge ER and other Muslims that were
still on Facebook and short you could
say well come on Reuters was actively

name:John Oliver

text:looking for those but you know who else
could do that maybe a company worth 500
billion dollars
Reuters doesn't have 500 billion dollars
their journalist doesn't even seem to
have a decent webcam get the man a

name:John Oliver

text:decent webcam Reuters his work is
 important and despite its 60
hole Burmese speakers Facebook is still
struggling with the language there in
fact earlier this year there community
standards were so badly missed

name:John Oliver

text:translated into Burmese that instead of
saying we take our role in keeping abuse
of our service seriously they said we
take our role seriously by abusing our
services and small things like that
really matter

name:John Oliver

text:even punctuation can change the meaning
of a sentence for example and this is
true Bill Cosby once wrote a book that
I'm guessing was meant to be called come
on people but they admitted the comma so
it read come on people

name:John Oliver

text:and deep down perhaps that's when we
should have known and look look I am NOT
saying that the challenges Facebook is
facing and not significant but for a
company that moves fast and break things
they have sure moved slowly in trying to

name:John Oliver

text: fix them and until they do it is
painfully obvious that everyone should
be treating anything on their site with
extreme skepticism and see Facebook for
what it actually is a fetid swamp of
mistruths and outright lies interspersed

name:John Oliver

text:with the occasional reminder of a dead
pet that's it
that's what it is so instead of
producing idyllic ads about connecting
the world at the very very least
Facebook should be producing ads that

name:John Oliver

text:prepare countries for how to deal with
their product Oh suggest something like
this hi we're Facebook we're connecting
the world
and we're coming to your country whether
you like it or not so there's one thing

name:John Oliver

text:about Facebook you should probably know
somewhere between eighty and a hundred
percent of what's on our site is
 complete my Facebook
page is full of lies about how happy I
am my Facebook page say I go to yoga

name:John Oliver

text:I'll be like three times my Facebook
page says I'm a 19 year old girl all my
photos are of me we are baby but I don't
have baby fun
we at Facebook believe in giving
everyone a voice without worrying too

name:John Oliver

text:much about what that voice then chooses
to say I mean how bad could it be I
don't believe the Holocaust happened Oh
yikes can someone please explain to me
why what Charlie Rose did was so wrong
I wouldn't post that but you can George

Clinton created aids yeah I'm sure about
that there is only one old cent winner

it's not our place to tell you you're
wrong we're about making connections can

sure can you connect me to coca-cola oh
we can absolutely do that but I gotta
admit I'm an animal a go-getter matter I
mean familiar I'm not sure what you just
said but it sounded great the point is

text:Facebook is a platform anyone can use to
do good or bad it's riddled with

gonna be able to control or contain it

time there's something you badly need to

America does not need

objectively getting less and less true

claim these planes are vital tools look
at Kenneth Copeland who along with his
wife Gloria are among the most

back he asked his followers to help buy
a 20 million dollar jet promising it
would only be used for church business
but a local news crew did some digging

investigation last February which first
raised questions about Copeland's
apparently personal use of his new

 this guy's like a psychotic reverse

Kenneth Copeland and he just shot them
right between the king eyes
now Copeland's ministry will tell you
that he reimburses the church for trips
like that but that still means he has

name:John Oliver

text:private jets reimbursement money and yet
despite that personal wealth people
still send Kenneth Copeland creflo
dollar and that asshole with two planes
lots and lots of money and that's partly
because they preach something called the

name:John Oliver

text:prosperity gospel which argues that
wealth is a sign of God's favor and
donations will result in wealth coming
back to you that idea sometimes takes
the form of seed faith the notion that
donations are seeds that you will one

name:John Oliver

text:day get to harvest let me show you that
in action the size of your seed will
determine the size of your harvest I
don't understand why but there's
something happens at a level where
people step into faith and give a

name:John Oliver

text:thousand dollars that don't happen at
other levels you're going to have a
breakthrough through this two hundred
and seventy three dollar seed all you've
got is a thousand dollars listen that's
not enough money anyway to buy the house

name:John Oliver

text:you're trying to give him the apartment
you just want to buy the house that's
not enough money anyway you get to that
phone and you put that seed in the
ground and watch God work it out the
argument is so your money in the ground

name:John Oliver

text:and you will reap returns multiple times
over except as an investment you'd be
better off burying your money in the
actual ground because that leaves that
way there is a chance your dog may dig
it up and give it back to you one day

name:John Oliver

text:good boy but but it can get even more
predatory because if say you don't have
a thousand dollars or perhaps have
significant credit card debts seed faith
can still work for you I have a feeling
that somebody there wants a credit card

name:John Oliver

text:debt wiped out that if you'll use your
faith as you so as you sold a thousand
on a credit card as you use your faith
as you use your faith God's gonna wipe
out your credit card indebtedness think
about that that is the equivalent of

treatment for cancer instead choosing to

and I'll let her daughter pick it up
from there I started funding notebooks
along her she passed away she believed

the network's they've she sowed enough
seen which was money the the greater
amount of seed that you sow according to
them the better chance you have the
better chance you have of getting healed

seed faith is the most disgusting seed
based concept since whatever the chia
seed pudding is Bonnie Parker gave
thousands of dollars to the coconut
church because she believed it was her

might think well that's crazy but it's
not an unreasonable interpretation of

Copeland sells numerous products on
healing through faith and has been

registered as a religious nonprofit or
especially a church you are given broad
exemptions over taxation and regulation

don't worry that's a little vague the
IRS regulations are close to meaningless

the term Church not specifically defined
they make no attempts to evaluate

text:come clean here we have been involved in
a correspondence with Robert Tilton
Church for the last seven months to try
and find out what he tells people so
settle in because this gets incredible
back in January I sent him $20 and a

name:John Oliver

text:letter asking to be added to his mailing
list within two weeks he sent me a
letter back thanking me for my donation
and claiming I believe that God has
supernaturally brought us together and
supernatural is a bit of a stretch I saw

name:John Oliver

text:him on television and I sent him some
money he wasn't my dead lover who came
back to help me with some pottery but
soon afterwards he sent me a second
letter and inside there was a one dollar
bill which was exciting until I saw the

name:John Oliver

text:inscription instructing me to send it
back to him with your best proof God
tithes or offering that's right I had to
send the one dollar back with an
additional recommended offering of $37
which I did so at this point were just

name:John Oliver

text:two letters in and already it's like
having a pen pal who's in deep with some
loan sharks this correspondence
continued back and forth like this until
March when he sent me three small
packets of colored oil that I was

name:John Oliver

text:instructed to pour on letters and send
back to him by specific dates along with
more money so I did that and in April I
got a letter in a manila envelope with a
message cheque enclosed and I thought
fantastic I've seeded and I've seeded

name:John Oliver

text:and have seeded here comes my harvest
then I open it and this is true it was a
check for five dollars from me made out
to pasture till his shirt
this went on for seven more letters and
then he sent me a piece of fabric in the

name:John Oliver

text:shape of some mountains I assumed at
this point I'd somehow reach to the
mountain level and surprise surprise he
asked me to send those mountains back to
him with some more money again so I did
and then he sent me another letter with

name:John Oliver

text:another single dollar bill inside he
told me to put that dollar bill in my
Bible for one night and then send it
back the next day with 49 more dollars
so that he can have it blessed with oil
and send me a one dollar bill back that

name:John Oliver

text:has been blessed adding I must warn you
not to rob God with your tithes and
offerings and then for emphasis
I can't urge you enough do not let this
one dollar bill stay in your house and
you know what I kept that one dollar

name:John Oliver

text:bill because that did not stop him the
letters kept on coming I received
another oil package more prayer cloths
and even and this is true an outline of
his foot which I was asked to trace my
foot on and mail back to him with more

name:John Oliver

text:money so as of tonight
I have sent him three hundred and
nineteen dollars and received 26 letters
that's almost one a week and again this
is all hilarious until you imagine these
letters being sent to someone who cannot

name:John Oliver

text:afford what he's asking for so at this
point I was getting pretty angry and
looking for a sign of what to do so I
watched a little more Robert Tilton and
the most amazing thing happened there's
a person watching me and you am very

name:John Oliver

text:frustrated with your purpose in life
that might be me Bob because I'm
extremely frustrated right now as it
seems my purpose in the last seven
months has been to send you money
through the mail

name:John Oliver

text:so so I will ask what's that message
that you have for me that's so strong
just then just then I had a word of
knowledge for someone that's really been
seeking God you have for a particular
purpose or a decision in your life and

name:John Oliver

text:that is when I realized the message
Robert Tilton was sending me was that I
should set up my own church to test the
legal and financial limits of what
religious entities that is what we have
done we filed paperwork last week

name:John Oliver

text:establishing a church called Our Lady of
Perpetual exemption and it was
disturbingly easy to make sure we did
this correctly we had this actual tax
lawyer walk us through the process now
while the IRS does not have a definition

name:John Oliver

text:of a church they do have a 14-point test
as a guideline for churches but not only
do you not have to meet all 14 points
we'd already met some of them by
accident
for instance you need an established

name:John Oliver

text:place of worship but we meet every
Sunday in this studio in New York that
genuinely counts our lawyer also advises
our church needed to be a distinct legal
entity so we've registered our church as
a nonprofit corporation in Texas a

name:John Oliver

text:state's I do not live in have never
lived in but which is somehow completely
fine for us to incorporate a church in
now the IRS is guidelines suggest you
need a creed and form of worship but
I'll always suggest if we could fulfill

name:John Oliver

text:the worship requirements by merely
leading everyone in some specific ritual
such as having congregants silently
meditate on the nature of fraudulent
churches so
let us do exactly that and bow our heads

name:John Oliver

text:in silent contemplation and lo another
box was ticked finally according to our
attorney the best case for church
membership will be made by those
individuals who are actually present in
the live studio audience who will

name:John Oliver

text:profess belief in the church's Creed so
what do you say live studio audience
do you profess your belief go to church
brothers and sisters welcome to Our Lady
of Perpetual exemption

[Music]
we get not truly we have witnessed a
miracle tonight

name:John Oliver

text:you
good evening assorted press yes John
Angela bishop from there were ten
estranged Allah we meet again my old
enemy I appreciate it I love your work
and I want to know just how close did

name:John Oliver

text:you get to Russell Crowe's jockstrap
well how close do you want to get as a
human being and narrow that by three
feet really I was I had a close personal
experience with cross strap the kind of
experience that you don't go into life

name:John Oliver

text:desiring and you end life regretting
yeah we were the for those who that
don't know we bought Russell Crowe I
think I mentioned out there is that way
we bought Russell Crowe's jockstrap and
we donated it to Blockbuster in Alaska

name:John Oliver

text:which has since closed the current
location of that jockstrap is not clear
I know they sent all the rest of their
stuff to the blockbuster in Oregon but
no one knows where the jockstrap is so I
would like to put out if anyone has seen

name:John Oliver

text:that jockstrap it's basically this big
made of leather and smells like
something you've never smelled before
well keep an eye out thanks John Thanks
yes arguably the most bizarre and
tumultuous well I don't wanna get to

name:John Oliver

text:Dickensian right but it's somewhere
between the best of times and the worst
of times and it's closer to the second
half of that sentence yeah it's so
that's this challenge for all shows our
show and any show like it it's that it's

name:John Oliver

text:innocence right so it's a fire hose of
information all time and it's hard to
know what to what to focus on so it's
very difficult it's you'd think it would
be easier but it's actually much much
harder question on the right

name:John Oliver

text:yeah back yes
hey John Jason Nathanson from ABC News I
mean we're just commenting back here
that doesn't seem the president Trump's
name has been mentioned once in the
whole show tonight does that surprise

name:John Oliver

text:you well I think it's just it's in the
drinking game I think we're just trying
to keep America sober everyone needs
their wits about them right now you
can't drink the pain away as his name
come up once wow that's that's something

name:John Oliver

text:it's very close to nothing but it is
something do you think it says that
we're moving on no it fucking doesn't
know if if anyone takes away from the
Emmys that we are moving on past the
presidency that we are currently either

name:John Oliver

text:half the way through or a quarter of the
way through we are totally fucked last
question yes yeah I'm Mariana with the
BBC yeah I'm American sorry I was gonna
say in British accent please I'm Moria
and I can't so I'm just wondering I

name:John Oliver

text:talked to a lot of young kids I do
social media for the BBC in North
America and a lot of people say their
favorite news outlet is you bullshit
I'll tell you it's true why do you think
you're so able to tell stories that

name:John Oliver

text:sometimes journalism organizations
aren't able to tell I totally kind of
refute the premise of that because we're
like we use the stories that journalism
outlets have reported on so without that
we actually don't have the ingredients

name:John Oliver

text:to make our show so yeah it's it's not
that stories are getting missed I think
sometimes it can feel like stories
aren't getting the attention that they
deserve and so that's when we can act
like an amplifier is that does that mean

name:John Oliver

text:Game of Thrones just won yeah either
that or I'm yeah
for what Best Drama that's great
it's very good
congratulations John thank you thank you
thank you very much

name:John Oliver

text:it's Game of Thrones
[Laughter]
[Applause]
our main story tonight and I cannot
believe I'm saying this is Donald Trump
and I say that I said that knowing that

name:John Oliver

text:every time his name is said out loud
he has a shattering orgasm we have
mostly ignored Trump on this show but he
is now won three states has been
endorsed by chris Christie and polish al
him leading most Super Tuesday states

name:John Oliver

text:which is a big deal since 1988 every
candidate who's won the most states on
Super Tuesday went on to become their
party's nominee so at this point Donald
Trump is America's back mold it may have
seemed harmless a year ago but now that

name:John Oliver

text:it's gotten frightening ly bigger it is
no longer wise to ignore it and I do
understand why Trump supporters might
like him he's unpredictable and
entertaining just look how he went after
Marco Rubio on Friday did you ever see a

name:John Oliver

text:guy sweat like this
it's Rubio
that's objectively funny just as it was
funny when a few years ago he tweeted I
would like to extend my best wishes to
all even the haters and losers on this

name:John Oliver

text:special date September the 11th he
wished haters and losers are happy 9/11
there is a part of me that even likes
this guy it's a part of me I hate but it
is a part of me and if you are someone
who's sick of the party establishment he

name:John Oliver

text:might seem like a protest candidate with
some attractive qualities we like him
like it is he says what he means I
honestly believe he's telling the truth
he's funding his own campaign nobody
owns him he's aggressive I think he's an

name:John Oliver

text:incredible businessman if he runs the
country like he runs his organization we
would be in good shape
Donald Trump can seem appealing until
you take a closer look much like the
lunch buffet and a strip club or the NFL

name:John Oliver

text:or having a pet chimpanzee sure it seems
fun but someday Coco's going to tear
your limbs off because let's
look at each of those qualities those
people listed first he tells it like it
is

name:John Oliver

text:does he because the website politifact
checks 77 of his statements and rated 76
percent of them as varying degrees of
false and I've witnessed this firsthand
he once attacked my old boss by tweeting
if Jon Stewart is so above it all and

name:John Oliver

text:legit why did he change his name from
Jonathan Leibovitz he should be proud of
his heritage and then two years later
rose I never attacked dopey Jon Stewart
for his phony last name would never do
that

name:John Oliver

text:and then just last year he claimed
falsely to have turned down an invite to
appear on this very boring show and
who's he trying to impress with that lie
our show's guests include sloths
and puppies we're basically a petting

name:John Oliver

text:zoo with a desk but when we pointed out
that he had never been invited this is
how he responded all of a sudden I see
people saying that John Oliver and her
st. John Oliver and I checked with my
people he asked me to be on the show

name:John Oliver

text:four or five times and I I don't even
hardly know who it was I wouldn't know
what he looks like
I wouldn't expect him to know who I was
although for his inevitable angry tweet
about this segment I'll tell him what I

name:John Oliver

text:look like I look like a nearsighted
parrot who works at a bank secondly it
was genuinely destabilizing to be on the
receiving end of a lie that confidence I
even checked to make sure that no one
had even accidentally invited him and of

name:John Oliver

text:course they hadn't and and I'm not even
sure he knows he's lying I think he just
doesn't care about what the truth is
Donald Trump gives the truth like this
Lima views the Supreme Court vacancy I
don't care about that in any way please

name:John Oliver

text: off I have a banana
so let's move on let's move on to his
next selling points that he is truly
independent and not beholden to anyone
or as he puts it I'm self-funding my
campaign I tell the truth he'll be

name:John Oliver

text:Spence of fact probably 2025 million
dollars okay let's break that down first
I'm rich therefore I tell the truth has
the same internal logic as I'm a vegan
therefore I know karate there is no
cause and effect between those two and

name:John Oliver

text:the correlation usually goes the other
way and while it is true that he hasn't
taken corporate money the implication
that he has personally spent twenty to
twenty five million dollars is a bit of
a stretch because what he's actually

name:John Oliver

text:done is loaned his own campaign
seventeen and a half million dollars and
has just personally given just two
hundred and fifty thousand dollars and
that's important because up until the
convention he can pay himself back for

name:John Oliver

text:the loan with campaign funds and if you
don't think there's a significant
difference between a gift and a loan try
giving your spouse an anniversary loan
and see how that goes
and even he himself sometimes admits

name:John Oliver

text:that his campaign is by no means
completely self-funded I'm self-funding
my campaign other than the little tiny
ones where they send in you know women
sending we had a woman seven dollars and
fifty nine cents what do you do how can

name:John Oliver

text:you send the money back do you know it's
a nice it's cute it's beautiful they
feel invested in you campaign he makes
it sound like women a stuffing grimy
dollar bills in envelopes writing Donald
Trump on the front and he's just too

name:John Oliver

text:kind to send them back but he's taken in
seven and a half million dollars in
individual contributions and if he
didn't want him maybe shouldn't have had
to donate button's on his website
because money isn't unsolicited when you

name:John Oliver

text:have to ask for someone's credit card
expiration date to receive it okay so
how about the claim that he is tough
well again I'm not sure about that
because for a tough guy he has
incredibly thin skin back in 1988 spy

name:John Oliver

text:magazine called him a short fingered
Bulgarian and ever since the editor
Graydon Carter says he receives
envelopes from Trump always with a photo
on which he circled his hand to
highlight the length of his fingers

name:John Oliver

text:usually with a nose reading see not so
short look his fingers seem fine but the
very fact he's so sensitive about them
is absolutely hilarious as is the fact
that those notes were apparently written
in gold sharpie which is so

name:John Oliver

text:quintessentially Donald Trump something
that gives the passing appearance of
wealth but is actually just a cheap tool
his signature tough talk often involves
lawsuits he loves to threaten to sue
people like he did with Rosie O'Donnell

name:John Oliver

text:she said I was bankrupt I never went
bankrupt so probably I'll sue her
because it would be fun I'd like to take
some money out of her fat-ass pockets of
course of course he needs to take Rosie
O'Donnell to court to take money out of

name:John Oliver

text:her pockets because his tiny tiny
fingers are too short to
he never sued Rosie O'Donnell in fact
he's repeatedly threatened people with
lawsuits and not followed through
including the rapper Mac Miller lawrence

name:John Oliver

text:O'Donnell Vanity Fair and an activist
who launched a petition for Macy's to
drop Trump's products I'll sue you is
Trump's version of bazinga it doesn't
really mean anything but he says it all
the time but perhaps Trump's biggest

name:John Oliver

text:selling point as a candidate is his
success and where could people get that
idea from I'm really rich I actually
think I have the best temperament people
love me and you know what I've been very
successful everybody loves me I went to

name:John Oliver

text:an Ivy League school
I'm very highly educated I know words I
had the best words oh please
literally the biggest word in the
sentence I have the best words is the
word words well it's worth noting well

name:John Oliver

text:yes he has made more money than most of
us will make in a lifetime not only did
he get a multi-million dollar
inheritance from his father but he's
also lost a huge amount and this is
where we need to be careful because as

name:John Oliver

text:we've learned he will he will threaten
to sue your fat ass pockets with his
cocktail sausage fingers
if you talk about his company's
bankruptcies so I will just let his own
daughter describe the state of his

name:John Oliver

text:finances at one point in his life I
remember once my father and I were
walking down Fifth Avenue and there was
a homeless person sitting sitting right
outside of Trump Tower and I remember my
father pointing to him and saying you

name:John Oliver

text:know that guy has eight billion dollars
more than me because he was in such
extreme debt at that point you know and
that really shows you the indomitable
spirit of Donald Trump to fall to his
lowest point and in that very moment

name:John Oliver

text:still find a way to be kind of a dick to
a homeless guy now now his campaign
claims his current worth is in excess of
ten billion dollars and they've written
it in all caps so it must be true
but others have disputed that figure in

name:John Oliver

text:fact a book won't suggested that Trump
might be worth a mere 150 to 250 million
dollars which Trump protested by suing
the writer for 5 billion dollars which
is a pretty roundabout way of getting
half the way to 10 billion and you

name:John Oliver

text:should note for the record Trump lost
that lawsuit twice but I am glad that he
sued if only because during the
deposition he explained that his
estimate of his net worth fluctuates
based on and I quote feelings even my

name:John Oliver

text:own feelings and that can change rapidly
from day to day think about that he
claimed that his net worth changes
depending on his mood which makes
absolutely no sense partly because he
always seems to be in the same mood

name:John Oliver

text:specifically smug yet gassy a
significant portion of his self
valuation is intangible his brand is
what he values very much and it his
disclosure form that is released it's
about three billion dollars that's what

name:John Oliver

text:he values his brand as exactly he values
his own name at 3 billion dollars and
I'm not saying a name can't have value
it's why people will pay $120 for a
plain white t-shirt that is designed by
Kanye West I don't want just any white

name:John Oliver

text:t-shirts they want one designed by a
bored sociopath with a finger free anus
but three billion dollars seems a bit
high especially because while Trump has
said if I put my name on something you
know it's gonna be good over the years

name:John Oliver

text:his name has been on some things that
have arguably been very uncooked
including Trump shuttle which no longer
exists Trump vodka which was
discontinued Trump magazine which folded
trunk world's magazine which also folded

name:John Oliver

text:Trump University over which he's being
sued and of course the travel booking
site go Trump calm those grief existence
was I imagine a real thorn in the side
of anyone hoping got Trump calm feature
a single thing worth masturbating to and

name:John Oliver

text:that's not even mentioning licks when it
comes to great steaks I've just raised
the stakes Trump steaks are the world's
greatest steaks and I mean that in every
sense of the word and the sharper image
is the only store where you can buy them

name:John Oliver

text:not only can you not buy those steaks
anymore but why did he sell them at the
sharper image that is a weird choice I
will take a massage chair an indoor
waterfall and eight and a half pounds of
the finest meat in America and sure

name:John Oliver

text:every business executive is bound to
have a few missteps but Trump's lack of
sound financial instincts is perhaps
best exemplified by the business that he
put his name on back in 2006 just before
the entire housing market collapsed I

name:John Oliver

text:think it's a great time to start a
mortgage company we're gonna have a
great company it's Trump mortgage and
Trump mortgage calm and it's gonna be a
terrific company yeah it wasn't in fact
starting a mortgage company in 2006 with

name:John Oliver

text:one of the worst decisions you could
possibly make but I guess you can
convince yourself it was a good idea
when you say 30 words and five of them
are great great terrific Trump and Trump
and you might say well never mind side

name:John Oliver

text:business is what he really is
is a builder but a building with Trump
written on it is not necessarily owned
by him he may have just licensed his
name to them something he claims is
actually better than ownership you don't

name:John Oliver

text:put up money you don't put up anything
spoken like a true builder and some of
those licensed buildings sell his
reputation hard like the sales video for
the Trump Ocean Resort in northern
Mexico I'm very very proud of the fact

name:John Oliver

text:that when I build I have investors that
follow me all over people ask me what is
Trump stand for more than anything else
and if I use one word it's always
quality right but it's easy to throw
around the word quality have you ever

name:John Oliver

text:stayed at a quality in the pillows are
stuffed with hair they fished out of the
bathtub drain
he was never the builder for that
project which was later abandoned
leaving would-be condo buyers like

name:John Oliver

text:William Flint who lost a hundred and
sixty eight thousand dollars feeling
understandably betrayed Donald Trump was
an expert in these types of projects or
so we thought
in a deposition for a lawsuit regarding

name:John Oliver

text:the property Trump's son Donald Trump
jr. conceded that the Trump brand could
lead people to think a project was a
solid investment there's one of the
things that you've learned through this
process is that the Trump name bring

name:John Oliver

text:stability and their viability to the
project I don't have a bring stability
or viability but I imagine certain
people feel that and that might actually
be the most honest slogan for the Trump
campaign from 2016 I don't know if it

name:John Oliver

text:brings stability or viability but I
imagine certain people feel that not
only good investors in that property sue
Donald Trump they also did in Trump
Tower tamper another project that never
got off the ground and in both cases

name:John Oliver

text:Trump characteristically deflected blame
onto the developers and you would think
those investors will be facing it up
impossible legal battle given Trump's
tough talk when I get sued I take it
right oil tits take it all the way you

name:John Oliver

text:know what happens if you settle suits
you get sued more it's true I don't
settle anything I don't settle guess
what
he settled both those cases but the
problem is even when you condemn monster

name:John Oliver

text:we prove Trump to be wrong it's somehow
never seems to matter
you can hold his feet to the fire but
it'll just stand there on the stumps
bragging about his fireproof thought
skin

name:John Oliver

text:and that may be because he has spent
decades turning his own name into a
brand synonymous with success and
quality and he's made himself the mascot
for that brand like Ronald McDonald or
Chef Boyardee and that is who we have

name:John Oliver

text:seen in the apprentice or Wrestlemania
or home alone - but if he's actually
going to be the Republican nominee it's
time to stop thinking of the mascot and
start thinking of the man because a
candidate for president needs a coherent

name:John Oliver

text:set of policies whatever you think about
Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz at least you
basically know where they stand but
Trump's opinions have been wildly
inconsistent
he's been pro-choice and pro-life for

name:John Oliver

text:and against assault weapon bans in favor
of both bringing in Syrian refugees and
deporting them out of the country and
that inconsistency can be troubling just
this morning for instance he was asked
about the fact that David Duke former

name:John Oliver

text:Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan had
told supporters to vote for him and this
was his answer will you unequivocally
condemn David Duke and say that you
don't want his vote or that of other
white supremacists in this election what

name:John Oliver

text:you see you understand I don't know
anything about David Duke okay I don't
know anything about what you're even
talking about with white supremacy or
white supremacists honestly I don't know
David Duke I don't believe I've ever met

name:John Oliver

text:him I pretty sure I didn't meet him and
I just don't know anything about him
really that's your best answer there
because you definitely know who he is
partly because you called him a bigot
and a racist in the past but that's not

name:John Oliver

text:even the point the point is with
an answer like that you are either
racist or you are pretending to be and
at some point there is no difference
there and sure he disavowed David Juke
later in the day but the scary thing is

name:John Oliver

text:we have no way of knowing which of his
inconsistent views he will hold in
office will he stand by a statement that
vaccines are linked to autism or his
belief that Mexico is sending us rapists
oh and what about that plan he had to

name:John Oliver

text:defeat Isis we're fighting a very
politically correct war with the
terrorists you have to take out their
families when you get these terrorists
you have to take out their families they
care about their lives don't kid

name:John Oliver

text:yourself what you say they don't care
about the less you have to take out
their families that is the frontrunner
for the Republican nomination advocating
a war crime and he might say he was
joking or he's changed his mind about

name:John Oliver

text:any of these things and private
individuals are allowed to change their
minds we all do it but when he's sworn
in as president on January 20th 2017 on
that day his opinions are going to
matter and you will remember that date

name:John Oliver

text:because it's the one that time travelers
from the future will come back to to try
and stop the whole thing from happening
I get that the character of Donald Trump
is entertaining and that he says things
that people want to hear and I know his

name:John Oliver

this one Supporter explain what it means
to her I was a little girl well I didn't

knew that he was a wealthy successful

meant riched it meant success she's not
even wrong Trump does sound rich it's
almost onomatopoeic Trump is the sound

completed the very name Trump is the
cornerstone of his brand if only there

from the man he really is well guess
what there is because it turns out the
name Trump was not always his family's
name one biographer found that a
prescient ancestor had changed it from

and is much less magical if the sounds
produced when they morbidly obese pigeon

text:falling off the shelf in a gas station
mini-mart and it may seem weird to bring

the presidency of Donald Trump the man
voted least edible by cannibal magazine
six years in the road and I know I

name:John Oliver

text:honestly know that the prospect of
talking about Trump yet again feels
exhausting we're all so tired of him
every room in America should have a sign
on the wall that counts the number of
minutes that it's been since someone

name:John Oliver

text:brought up his name but but that
is the thing Trump's presidency is like
one of his handshakes it pulls you in
whether you like it or not he's had so
many terrible moments this year you
probably forgot about many of them

name:John Oliver

text:remember when he creepily told the
French president's wife that she was in
good shape or or when his tacky Golf
Resort was touted on the State
Department website or when he shoved the
prime minister of Montenegro out of the

name:John Oliver

text:way and a nato event look how proud of
himself Ian's look Brown Diaz you should
at least have to know that Montenegro is
a country before making a move that says
suck it Montenegro and there were also
quieter but no less alarming moments

name:John Oliver

text:like when he explained how hard he's
been fighting to bring clean coal back
without appearing to understand what
that actually is it's just been
announced that a second brand-new coal
mine where they're going to take out

name:John Oliver

text:clean coal meaning they're taking out
call they're going to clean it is
opening in the state of Pennsylvania is
it possible that Trump is well versed in
and is referring to flue gas
desulphurization fluidized bed

name:John Oliver

text:combustion and selective catalytic
reduction sure it's possible but let's
agree it's considerably more likely that
he thinks you just take a bunch of coal
and scrub a dub it with a big ol sponge
oh yeah that's right I'm saying the

name:John Oliver

text:president fundamentally doesn't has
dander what he's talking about
and you know what that means we've got
it
I thought we got in that time all right
that's better okay what do you think I

name:John Oliver

text:don't hate myself too all right
the point is tonight let's pull back
from the daily Trump induced chaos and
take a look at the norms that his
presidency has violated they're not the
obvious ones like the fact that he never

name:John Oliver

text:released his tax returns or that his own
daughter and son-in-law work in the
White House although admittedly I am
using the word work there so generously
that I should be able to deduct it as a
charitable donation on my taxes or that

name:John Oliver

text:instead of putting his assets into a
blind trust to help reduce conflicts of
interest he simply showed America that
he has many large stacks of paper
presumably containing the sentence I
can't believe I'm getting away with this

name:John Oliver

text:printed 750,000 times
No instead we're gonna talk about
Trump's assault on something even more
basic the norms governing how our
leaders engage with us and how in turn
that affects the way that we engage with

name:John Oliver

text:one another it's why even the notion of
getting him can feel so hopelessly
futile and let's first stipulate that it
definitely doesn't help this so often
what Trump says is complete nonsense we
often read transcripts of Trump speeches

name:John Oliver

text:and it's something that everyone should
actually do once in a while because when
you strip away
he's blindly confident entertaining
delivery and just read his words it is
staggering how incoherent he is here is

name:John Oliver

text:a word-for-word reading of a speech
where he talked about the Iran nuclear
deal you look at the nuclear deal the
thing that really bothers me
it would have been so easy and it's not
as important as these lives are nuclear

name:John Oliver

text:is so powerful my uncle explained that
to me many many years ago the power and
that was 35 years ago he would explain
the power of what's going to happen and
he was right who would have thought but
when you look at what's going on with

name:John Oliver

text:the four prisoners now it used to be
three now it's for both limitless
now I would have said it's all on the
messenger fellas and it is fellas
because you know they don't they haven't
figured that the women are smarter right

name:John Oliver

text:now than the men so you know it's going
to take them about another 150 years but
the Persians are great negotiators the
Iranians are great negotiators so and
they they just killed they just killed
us is not a functional use of

name:John Oliver

text:language that is a drunk driver crashing
a pickup truck full of alphabet soup
trucks actual speech patterns sound like
when you write a long text by choosing
only the predictive text your iPhone
suggests for you seriously

name:John Oliver

text:we wrote a message like that starting
with the words the nuclear and here is
what we got the nuclear test program was
not opposed by the other person who
knows what they want and then the delay
is not being done by any other country

name:John Oliver

text:and that is not the only way to make
sure the world can do more things and
things like that and gentlemen and then
the other people who have been told to
leave them alone with their children who
are also very sad meaning an iPhone

name:John Oliver

text:would be a more coherent President of
the United States but with Trump we are
familiar enough with his speech patterns
that you get the basic gist of what he's
trying to say the real damage isn't in
how he says things but from three key

name:John Oliver

text:techniques that he uses to insulate
himself from criticism and consequence
and if we are not extremely careful all
three could have serious impacts that
far outlast his presidency and let's
start with the first one D legitimizing

name:John Oliver

text:the media now Trump has been attacking
the press since he declared his
candidacy and in a broader sense
he's been waging war on the very concept
of truth ever since he first turned to
his mom and said Dada and she said no

name:John Oliver

text:I'm mama
and he said fake news and his pants
now the difference now is he's crying
fake news as president of the United
States and he is openly proud of it to
the point that he recently tried to take

name:John Oliver

text:ownership of the term itself the media
is is really the word I think one of the
greatest of all terms I've come up with
is fake I guess other people have used
it perhaps over the years but I've never
noticed it

name:John Oliver

text:he just took credit for inventing the
term fake news which from the record he
did not meaning what he just said was
technically fake fake News News and you
could imagine him saying well I'm not
the first politician to criticize the

name:John Oliver

text:press what about Hillary Clinton
what about Barack Obama what about
Bernie Sanders and that actually brings
us to Trump's second technique something
called what about ISM it's the practice
of changing the subject to someone else

name:John Oliver

text:is perceived wrongdoing now Trump does
this all the time most famously when he
was asked why he hadn't forcefully
condemned the neo-nazis in
Charlottesville and this was his
response what about the alt left they

name:John Oliver

text:came charging at the as you say the alt
right do they have any semblance of
guilt what about the fact that came
charging that they came charging with
clubs in the hand swinging clubs do they
have any problem well actually no

name:John Oliver

text:because a Nazi killing someone with a
car is so heinous any other issues that
might be up for debate under any other
circumstances kind of have to wait their
turn you can be wearing Crocs with socks
but if you're using those soft Crocs to

name:John Oliver

text:kick Hitler in the balls do you know
what I'm suddenly not so focused
on the footwear now now this technique
of saying what about is actually an old
Soviet propaganda tool and the reason it
is dangerous is but it's because it

name:John Oliver

text:implies that all actions regardless of
context share a moral equivalency and
since nobody is perfect all criticism is
hypocritical and everybody should do
whatever they want it is a depressingly
effective tool which is why on trump's

name:John Oliver

text:favorite network you hear it all the
time the mainstream media focused on the
Trump campaign and allegations of
collusion with the Russians but what
about the Democrats possible ties to
Moscow former National Security Advisor

name:John Oliver

text:General Michael Flynn investigated for
his private meeting with Russia but what
about Hillary Clinton the media wants to
call into question the credibility and
the trustworthiness of this
administration but what about Benghazi

name:John Oliver

text:what about the blatant lies that the
Obama administration told us what about
the fact that Ben Rhodes bragged about
lying to the media and the public about
the Iran deal you know what about the
fact that Jonathan Gruber basically said

name:John Oliver

text:the American people was stupid okay stop
stop
because here is the thing none of the
errors those people may have made in the
past excused the Trump administration's
actions a defense attorney could not

name:John Oliver

text:stand up in court and say maybe my
client did murder those people but I ask
you this
what about Jeffrey Dahmer what about Al
Capone what about the guy from The
Silence of the Lambs

name:John Oliver

text:I rest my case here people I rest my
case it doesn't actually solve a problem
or win an argument the point is just to
muddy the waters which can make the
other side mad and that actually brings
us to Trump's third technique trolling

name:John Oliver

text:now trolling itself has been around for
years
it's basically 80% of what happens on
the internet it's it's when a YouTube
commenter says something willfully
provocative like saying I've aged to

name:John Oliver

text:like an apple core in a dumpster or that
I look like a pickle with
glasses it doesn't matter whether they
mean any of that the point is just to
get a reaction and to hurt my feelings
which by the way it absolutely does but

name:John Oliver

text:but Trump Trump may well be the first
ever troll to be elected president and
that's right I said elected remember
tenth president sprinkles fuzz wizard he
assumed office after William Henry
Harrison died and if you're thinking

name:John Oliver

text:hold on sprinkles fuzz wizard was not
America's tenth president really who was
America's tenth president exactly let's
assume I'm right the point is as a troll
Trump often does things that have no
effect other than to piss off his

name:John Oliver

text:perceived enemies like when he tweeted
this wrestling gif of himself body
slamming CNN or attacked Mika Brzezinski
by saying she was bleeding badly from a
facelift or as we mentioned earlier
tonight called a leader with nuclear

name:John Oliver

text:weapons short and fat and Trump even
once retweeted a claim that he was the
most superior troll on the whole of
Twitter calling it a great compliment
which it is not because sometimes when
you do something that makes a lot of

name:John Oliver

text:people mad it's because and bear with me
here you're a dick
[Applause]
urinates in every heating vent and they
get mad at you you're not an epic troll
sticking it to the snowflake you

name:John Oliver

text:just some asshole
but the thing is Trump's trolling is not
actually without political value despite
Trump's few real policy accomplishments
to date he has consistently achieved one
thing and that is making his enemies

name:John Oliver

text:unhappy and for many Trump supporters
that itself counts as a major victory
just listen to how Fox and Friends
reacted after Trump freaked people out
by standing with military leaders during
rising tensions with North Koreans

name:John Oliver

text:suggesting that it was the calm before
the storm
I think he's trolling the media he is I
think he's totally trolling me they do
something like that even the smile and
the wink those of us that are sick of

name:John Oliver

text:the status quo the Forgotten men and
women who voted for President Trump want
that town to freak out I want those
reporters but what do you what do you
mean it's beautiful to watch is it why
I'm genuinely serious who benefits from

name:John Oliver

text:mass confusion about whether or not
we're about to go to war are there
thousands of unemployed factory workers
across the Midwest going well the plant
closed down and I lost my health care
but somewhere a Washington Post reporter

name:John Oliver

text:is scared of dying so things are looking
up maca
judging your political success on how
bad you make other people feel makes
just about as much sense as judging your
success as a zookeeper by how many bears

name:John Oliver

text:you wow that is not your job I mean
I guess it's impressive in its own way
but it's definitely not what you're
supposed to be doing and the surest
proof of trolling often comes when a
troll is confronted because that's when

name:John Oliver

text:they have to either put up or shut up
you may have heard about cases where
people tracked down the source of
something awful that was posted online
only to find some sullen 15 year
old who just shrugs and goes wooden oh

name:John Oliver

text:whoa I wrote that or just did it stop
horse could be so many questions
well that is basically our president now
I'll show you remember when Trump said
that Obama had surveilled him in Trump
Tower tweeting how low has President

name:John Oliver

text:Obama gone to tap my phones
watch what happens when he was asked to
justify that well you saw what happened
with surveillance and I think that was
inappropriate what does that mean sir
you can figure that out you see like the

name:John Oliver

text:reason I asked as you said he you called
him sick and bad look you can figure it
out yourself
he was very nice to me with words but
and when I was with him but after that
there has been no relationship but you

name:John Oliver

text:stand by that claim about I don't say
anything I just you can take it the way
you want okay so let's walk through what
just happened there on the internet he
claimed that his predecessor committed
an extremely serious crime but in person

name:John Oliver

text:he is suddenly backing down first saying
Obama was very nice to me with words
then that I don't stand by anything
which is one of the most frightening
lean nihilistic sentences a president
can say I would honestly rather hear

name:John Oliver

text:that from a clown holding a knife than a
president because at least when a clown
says I don't stand by anything you think
yeah that kind of makes sense please
make it quick and look it gets worse
because that interview kept going and

name:John Oliver

text:Trump was explicitly given the
opportunity to set the record straight
for the fake news media but he flat-out
refused I just wanted to find out that
you're the other president United States
you said he was sick and bad because he

name:John Oliver

text:anyway you can take it any way you want
but I'm asking you because you don't
want to do fake news I want to hear you
don't have to ask why not because I have
my own opinions you can have your own
opinions but I want to know your

name:John Oliver

text:opinions you're the president the United
States it's enough thank you thank you
very much
okay so there is a lot that is
infuriating about that clip but chunk
going back to his desk and pretending to

name:John Oliver

text:work hard is an objectively funny thing
to do that's like your dog avoiding
questions by pretending to do his taxes
you never do this why would you need to
do it now well there is nothing new
about any of these techniques they are

name:John Oliver

text:now coming out of the Oval Office which
not only legitimizes them it risks them
spreading and that sadly is happening
last month Congressman Paul Gosar used
all three techniques first he suggested
in an interview that the march in

name:John Oliver

text:Charlottesville may have been a false
flag operation created by the left which
is pretty trolli behavior and when
confronted about it he deployed the
other two tools it's all been debunked
there was there was no mark absolutely

name:John Oliver

text:not to bunk for whatsoever so speak to
your Z theory that you have put out
there has been debunked it has not been
two-month look at look at what CNN has
talked about with with what's going on
with the Clinton administration right

name:John Oliver

text:now with the dossier hardly an aspect in
regards to Devon you're not real news
you're fake news sir everything you've
said has been debunked why are you
continuing to put this out there so he's
basically just copying trunk and if

name:John Oliver

text:there is one thing worse than something
terrible it's a cover band of that
terrible thing if Trump is Nickelback
that man is Bickle nack
not as good at it as the original and a
horrible sign that the disease is

name:John Oliver

text:spreading the problem is if that becomes
the level of discourse in this country
we are seriously and lastingly
and just this week we saw some of these
techniques pushed to the absolute limit
by the scandal involving Alabama Senate

name:John Oliver

text:candidate Roy Moore who has denied
allegations of sexual misconduct with a
14-year old when he was 32 and called
them fake news now what Sean Hannity
then used what about ISM to derail the
discussion about it

name:John Oliver

text:this 14-year old girl purportedly
according to the Washington Post told
two of her girlfriends what happened
here's a tough question real-time do you
think Bill Clinton in retrospect was a
predator but that is not what this

name:John Oliver

text:discussion is about you might as well
have said here's a tough question if you
had to guess how many lobsters are there
like total in the world is that worth
discussing sure but first let's finish
talking about the Senate candidate who

name:John Oliver

text:may have made sexual advances on a child
and look whether Clinton engaged in
predatory behavior is absolutely a
legitimate question but it shouldn't
really inform what we do about Roy Moore
and even if you believe that Democrats

name:John Oliver

text:are guilty of a double standard the
solution is not to have no standard
whatsoever that is why it's so important
to train ourselves to identify these
techniques because their natural
endpoint is the erosion of our ability

name:John Oliver

text:to decide what's important have an
honest debate and hold one another
accountable and that erosion can be so
gradual that it's difficult to spot it's
like being murdered by a sloth it
happens very slowly and you might not

name:John Oliver

text:notice until it's too late
listen this is all very bleak I cannot
pretend that it isn't which is why it is
so important to take some hope from this
year's small victories like the Muslim
ban being blocked by the court after

name:John Oliver

text:massive public protests to appeal
Obamacare stalling thanks in part to
people pressuring their lawmakers and
just this week
Java's week in Virginia voters rejected
Ed Gillespie for governor after he ran a

name:John Oliver

text:trump style dog-whistle campaign and
that is encouraging because it's nice to
know that if you use Trump tactics in a
Virginia gubernatorial election you do
not get to be Governator
now further down the ballot there

name:John Oliver

text:Tuesday also mark the defeat of Bob
Marshall who earlier this year proposed
a so-called bathroom bill he lost to
Danica Rome who will now be Virginia's
[Applause]
is already markedly different

name:John Oliver

text:Danica you were running against Robert
Marshall and incumbent 13 term incumbent
he's also a man who referred to himself
as Virginia's chief homophobe he refused
to debate you during the campaign you
have anything you want to say to him

name:John Oliver

text:come January delegate Marshall will deal
on my constituents and I'm not gonna
disrespect my own constituents he openly
disrespected her but given the
opportunity she chose not to respond by
tweeting I'll fight for bob's rights to

name:John Oliver

text:use any bathroom he wants but it's too
late
he already the bed on election day
sad it's nice it's nice not to have that
and look Tuesday's results should not
make you complacent they are absolutely

name:John Oliver

text:no guarantee that the midterms will turn
out at all well that is why though you
should take these moments of
encouragement to help you keep going
because the trump presidency is
basically a marathon it's painful it's

name:John Oliver

text:pointless and the majority of you didn't
even agree to run it you would just
signed up by your dumbest friend
and the fact is we're not even at Mile 6
right now or possibly even mile 3 so
there is a long way to go and though

name:John Oliver

text:you're exhausted and your whole body is
screaming for you to give up and your
nipples are chafing for some reason the
stakes are too high for any of us to
stop and I do realize that I'm saying
that as we're about to stop doing shows

name:John Oliver

text:for the year but but here's the thing we
won't actually be going away entirely
you might remember earlier this year we
used our catheter cowboy to try and get
information to the president in the ad
brakes of Fox and Friends well Trump is

name:John Oliver

text:still watching that show and we know
this because the Times wrote a generally
negative piece about its enormous
influence on him and because of that
called it the most powerful TV show in
America a sentiment that the hosts were

name:John Oliver

text:very excited about this program the
program you're watching is according to
the New York Times the most powerful TV
show in America why Steve because we
have the best viewers yes no absolutely
don't saying that we have the best views

name:John Oliver

text:fighting that
you guys are fine the best audience
belongs to Ellen because this is how
they greet her she is now
none of you did that when I came
out just 45 minutes after that

name:John Oliver

text:information was on Fox Trump tweeted Wow
the failing New York Times said about
Fox & Friends the most powerful TV show
in America so information goes right
from that show into his brain which is
terrible because we would genuinely be

name:John Oliver

text:better off if Trump was getting daily
briefings from an actual Fox and his
friends a hedgehog and a weasel with its
head stuck in a tin can
but if Trump is going to keep watching
that show we are going to spend our

name:John Oliver

text:hiatus sneaking information through our
catheter Cowboys so so so a number of
commercials are going to be airing on
Fox News over the next few months here
is the first one the tinted catheter
patients I'm a professional cowboy I use

name:John Oliver

text:catheters and there's two things I know
I don't like pain when I calf and the
term clean coal doesn't refer to the
physical act of cleaning ability to be
impossible
coal is cold clean coal is a marketing

name:John Oliver

text:term the coal industry came up with for
stuff like carbon capture and
sequestration an expensive process that
shown limited results at best
also Frederick Douglass is dead later
this week and keep an eye out for more

bunch up his sleeve the US Virgin

text:we are finally in an election year so
for our main story tonight let's look at
voting the cornerstone of American
democracy the unshakable principle that
everyone should have an equal vote even
idiots even this guy now I know it's

name:John Oliver

text:painful but his votes should count as
much as yours it should count as much as
the presidents that's what America is
all about now in recent years some
states have made voting easier for
instance three states now hold their

name:John Oliver

text:elections almost entirely by mail and 30
states plus DC now let you register to
vote online
sadly others have gone in the opposite
direction because depending on who you
are and where you live you may face new

name:John Oliver

text:obstacles to voting this November thanks
to among other things the Supreme
Court's decision to weaken the Voting
Rights Acts for instance since 2011
seven states have curtailed early voting
and 13 have added requirements the

prevent those crimes
the only crime it prevents is voter

could happen well without photo ID I
mean let's be clear I don't want dead
people voting in the state of South
Carolina I've said that from the very
beginning and authorities say there is

name:John Oliver

text:evidence that dead people voting is a
real problem according to a statewide
investigation by South Carolina's
Department of Motor Vehicles in January
it found that 953 ballots were cast by
voters who were deceased now that's true

such a stir that one lawmaker stated we
must have certainty in South Carolina
that zombies aren't voting and look he's
right he's right no one wants that
except possibly for upstart candidate

Enforcement Division investigated the
DMV's claims it found no real basis for
them in fact of the prior elections 207

where someone had the same name as a

were an array of random clerical errors

powerful one so is the argument that
people should vote for the candidate who

so let's vet these candidates not as
spoilers or as protest votes but as

name:John Oliver

text:legitimate potential presidents and
we'll start with Jill Stein the
candidate who looks most like she
believes Carib is just as good as
chocolate
now Stein is currently polling around 2%

name:John Oliver

text:and she has a lot going for her she's a
doctor who practiced internal medicine
for 27 years and she has a broadly
appealing pitch from environmental
issues to expanding LGBTQ rights to
reducing income inequality but when it

name:John Oliver

text:comes to policy we all know the devil is
in the details so how exactly is she
going to accomplish her goals and let's
start with the plan that has been
central to her candidacy we're the one
party that's actually calling for

name:John Oliver

text:canceling student debt and bailing out a
generation of young people like we
bailed out the bankers on Wall Street we
can do that for this generation and
unleash them to be the stimulus package
of our dreams okay hold on because

name:John Oliver

text:stimulus package of your dreams
sounds like how Paul Krugman describes
his penis but but but she is right
student debt is a massive 1.3 trillion
dollar problem canceling it is Stein's
flagship proposal it is to her campaign

name:John Oliver

text:what the border wall is to Donald
Trump's so you would assume that she has
a well-thought-out coherent plan my
campaign is the only one that will do
for young people what our miss leaders
saw fit to do for Wall Street not that

name:John Oliver

text:long ago it was about four trillion in
free money in the form of so-called
quantitative easing which is a magic
trick that basically people don't need
to understand anymore about and that it
is a magic trick no it isn't though it

name:John Oliver

text:is a very complicated monetary policy
tool and while it might not be important
for most people to understand it you
certainly have to and I don't think you
do because for a start while Jill Stein
has said the president has the authority

name:John Oliver

text:to cancel student debt using
quantitative easing that is absolutely
wrong the President does not have that
authority only the Federal Reserve does
and it does not take Marting orders from
the White House because that would be

name:John Oliver

text:extremely dangerous you don't want to
give presidents the power to just create
new money whenever they want to think of
it all this if Joe xotic is elected you
don't want him to be able to order the
Fed to create money for the most lavish

name:John Oliver

text:tiger themed orgy the nation has
because they would then have to print
the $3,500 it would take to do that so
that issue alone makes our plan a
non-starter before we even get into the
fact that quantitative easing does not

name:John Oliver

text:apply here Stein is implying that it was
used to cancel banks debts and that is
absolutely not what it did using in a
way that she's describing amounts to a
president unilaterally passing a new law
and funding it by printing new money and

name:John Oliver

text:the the dangers of that should be pretty
obvious in terms of how fundamentally
flawed that is on every level
it's basically akin to saying I'll make
us energy independence by ordering the
post office to invade Canada no-till

name:John Oliver

text:that's impractical it's a terrible idea
and you don't seem to understand
anything about it when I first her
student debt proposal was her version of
Donald Trump's border wall I meant it
because the only way it could be any

name:John Oliver

text:more unlikely is if she claimed Mexico
was somehow going to pay for it and for
a candidate who seems to be running on
principle it can be hard to pin her down
on what those principles are after the
EU brexit vote her campaign issued a

name:John Oliver

text:statement in which she called the
decision a victory before changing it to
read I agreed with the UK Greens who
supported staying in the EU and in
response to charges that she was
anti-vaccination she tweeted there's no

text:it's not really fine but that is your
right but you are also going to need to
co-sign on one more awkward thing and
that is that Jill Stein recorded several

that sounds like the Indigo Girls

name:John Oliver

text:for now let's move on to Gary Johnson
the two-term governor of New Mexico and
the man who in most photographs seems to
be around 80% sure that he is running
for president so he has been polling
around 6% nationally which is pretty

name:John Oliver

text:remarkable given that his race has been
largely notable for moments like not
knowing what Aleppo is not being able to
name a world leader he admires and
whatever it is that he's doing here do
you think if you were able to get on the

name:John Oliver

text:debate stage that you could pull even I
think I could stand up there for a whole
day and not say anything and I'm loose
as well I'm not sure if he was doing
that with his tongue on purpose or if
Gary Johnson's tongue just decided it

name:John Oliver

text:I'm done and tried to escape through his
mouth but obviously law to Gary Johnson
than just mistakes for instance he is an
avid outdoorsman who loves mountain
climbing so much he was described
summiting Mount Everest like this people

name:John Oliver

text:ask me gosh what was it like to conquer
Mount Everest well I did not conquer
Mount Everest she lifted her skirt and I
got in there and got a beak and it was
really cool
okay okay I'm still a little confused

name:John Oliver

text:here did you actually climb Mount
Everest or did you just dry-hump the
side of it and then go home it was great
now smell my finger there's still some
mountain air on it what is wrong with
you now now as for his policies as with

name:John Oliver

text:Jill Stein there is a lot to like there
he supports marijuana legalization and
opposes the death penalty civil
forfeiture and police militarization but
scratch beneath the surface and there
are some positions you may be less

name:John Oliver

text:comfortable with frozen sea opposes
having a minimum wage and when he says
he's for smaller government he's not
kidding around governors could you name
three federal departments or agencies
that you would eliminate uh education

name:John Oliver

text:the Department of Commerce and Housing
and Urban Development how's that for
starters oh there he's giving up
government agencies left and right this
is Sophie's Choice if she hated all of
her children take both kids

name:John Oliver

text:I'm sick of stepping on Legos off you go
but but to be fair that is an
intellectually consistent position but
now watch him fold under the slightest
pressure would any of their functions
still be performed by the federal

name:John Oliver

text:government gosh if and you'd have to
assume that they were doing something
that was of value and yeah if they are
doing something of value yes we would we
would be looking to continue those
operations those departments all do a

name:John Oliver

text:lot of stuff you can't identify any
specific things they did here you're
asking you're asking three departments
and I'm giving them to you right but
then you take the assumption that they
should be a little with okay for the

name:John Oliver

text:record and this is probably obvious
those three departments do actually do
things of value assuming that you find
Pell grants mortgage insurance
low-income housing programs the National
Weather Service the Patent and Trademark

name:John Oliver

text:Office and the Census Bureau to be of
some value and if it comes as news to
you that that's what those departments
do well then hi Gary
I'm excited you're watching the show
quick piece of advice please stop trying

name:John Oliver

text:to Fountains and again again like Jill
Stein Johnson is prone to overly simple
solutions that could have disastrous
consequences just look at how he applies
his small-government approach to tax
policy if I could wave a magic wand I

name:John Oliver

text:would eliminate income tax I would
eliminate corporate tax I would abolish
the IRS and I would replace it all with
one federal consumption tax come on Gary
you have a magic wand and the first
thing you do is eliminate income tax

name:John Oliver

text:with it
shame on you the first thing anyone
should do is make soap tastes as good as
it smells and you don't judge me it's
not the only thing that I would do it's
just the first thing I would do magical

name:John Oliver

text:simple plan gets complicated very fast
because Johnson says his consumption tax
would be between 23 and 28 percent on
almost everything you buy and that could
clearly hurt poor people the most so his
answer is that every single home in

name:John Oliver

text:America would receive a pre-baked check
each month covering the cost of the
sales tax up to around the poverty line
but when a presidential advisory panel
studied a similar proposal a decade ago
they found that it's not just that

name:John Oliver

text:simple aside from the complexity of the
pre-baked program which by the way would
become America's largest entitlement
program ever for this policy to work
they suggested these sales tax would
have to be way more than 28% with the

name:John Oliver

text:burden falling heavily on the middle
class and to avoid all that they might
have to be savaged government cuts but
rather than honestly admit that Johnson
tries to wriggle out of the subject the
big problem with doing what you're doing

name:John Oliver

text:is you wind up cutting the amount of
revenues that governor government has to
work actually it's a revenue neutral the
whole the whole proposal that's not so
according economists that's not so easy
well then well maybe not your doing

name:John Oliver

text:Chris but by just to give you the
context why if you say the FairTax
number that's usually thrown out is 28%
this would be your consumption tax so
you're automatically reducing the 39%
from the top level down that creates an

name:John Oliver

text:issue about how you want to distribute
the tax burden you're writing a little
into into the we've figure what D
mean to in the weeds the only point of
discussing tax policy is to get into the
weeds that and preventing premature

name:John Oliver

text:ejaculation that's the two options and
if it can seem like Gary Johnson
occasionally just doesn't give a
maybe he doesn't because wait until you
hear his stance on combating climate
change should we take the long term view

name:John Oliver

text:and it comes to global warming I think
that we should and the long term view is
that in billions of years the Sun is
going to actually grow and encompass the
earth right so global warming is in our
in our future that's your plan

name:John Oliver

text:don't worry we'll all be dead eventually
anyway I guess we're just lucky that we
won't be around to see that day because
I do not want the last thing I hear to
be Gary Johnson saying the sun's not so
much conquered the earth it's merely

it no Gary why are you so weird the
point here is the more you look about

realize the lack of coverage they

key proposals begin to crumble under the
slightest scrutiny and look I would love

on November the eighth and comes out
saying I feel a hundred percent great
about what I just did in there is either
lying to themselves or did something

and that means as uncomfortable as this
is everyone has to own the floors of

hawkish Wall Street friendly embodiment

stand about politics an ill-tempered
mountain molester with a radical
dangerous tax plan that even he can't
defend or a conspiracy pandering
political neophyte with no clear

and who once recorded this folk rap
about the virtues of bicycling I feel
like we just figured out who or what
killed Biggie and Tupac and and before
you say well hold on John there is one

mentioned yet I will remind you he's
broke his and he will not wear a

psychics the only people with more
misplaced confidence than Michael

name:John Oliver

text:avenatti now chances are you haven't
thought about psychics in a while which
is weird there's not really a whole lot
else going on but if you watch daytime
TV at all you'll see that they pop up
all the time when she was just a toddler

name:John Oliver

text:she's a wife and a mom who also happens
to talk to dead people
please welcome celebrity pet psychic our
next guest is a clairvoyant to the Stars
bond they're all psychic okay
I guess it's good that at least dr. oz

name:John Oliver

text:isn't wearing scrubs in that clip but
I'd still like him to do more to signal
he now lacks credibility as a medical
professional I think a sandwich sign
that says walking joke is the clothing
choice that I would be comfortable with

name:John Oliver

text:and look before we go any further I am
NOT going to be litigating whether
psychics are real in this piece for one
they're not see no litigation required
also for anyone who does believe in
psychic powers I know there is nothing I

name:John Oliver

text:could say that could convince you
otherwise logic isn't the reason that
you believe in them and it won't be the
reason that you stop which is not to say
that I won't be showing you clips of
psychics up but that is only

name:John Oliver

text:because it's really funny this is a girl
who you said was beaten and killed okay
this little girl is me and you told
somebody that she's dead wait a minute
you didn't disappear I'm right here well
that's interesting isn't it yeah

name:John Oliver

text:that is interesting I guess her psychic
abilities didn't include predicting when
she'd be utterly humiliated on national
television and look it is easy to
dismiss the psychics as a joke really
easy fun too

name:John Oliver

text:but the fact of the matter is one recent
poll found 4 in 10 Americans believe in
psychics just think about that
statistically that means out of all the
people who saw John Travolta's Gotti
movie four of them believed in psychics

name:John Oliver

text:so whether they are real or not is
incidental
what matters is a lot of people think
they are and the psychic industries both
larger and grimmer than you might assume
by one estimate it's a two point

name:John Oliver

text:two billion dollar industry and there
has been a lot of predatory behavior
when the the FTC settled charges with
the companies behind these psychic
readers Network in 2002 the one that
featured Miss Cleo they found that over

name:John Oliver

text:one three-year period they had charged
people about a billion dollars and a
collected half of it they took in five
hundred million dollars I had no idea
psychics could make that much money
he's like finding out the second richest

name:John Oliver

text:person in the world behind Jeff Bezos is
this gamestop employee named Greg I mean
good for Greg I guess but now I've got a
lot of questions about Gamestop and
literally everything else so tonight
let's take a look at the psychic

name:John Oliver

text:industry particularly one of the most
insidious parts of it
mediums people who claim to be able to
communicate with the dead they are
everywhere on TV some even have their
own reality shows she's a professional

name:John Oliver

text:psychic Mary knows bad 9:00 on TLC
spirit is important to me just as
important as my hair and my nails medium
only on TLC the crazy thing about these
shows is how they choose to focus on the
psychics personal lives who gives a

name:John Oliver

text:about that if I actually believed they
could communicate with the dead that is
the only thing I'd want to see them
doing the Long Island medium can ask
Abraham Lincoln Gandhi and Shakespeare
anything she wants so tune in next week

name:John Oliver

text:as she thinks about getting bangs I want
to mixed mediums make for compelling TV
most people have seen at least one of
them bring someone to tears with
messages from dead loved ones like this
did you lose your husband man your

name:John Oliver

text:husband wants to thank you for caring
for him and allowing him to leave the
physical world with dignity and grace
now that woman is clearly genuinely
touched although I will say it is weird
that the conduit to the afterlife is for

name:John Oliver

text:some reason Theresa Caputo living proof
of what would happen if you added too
much baking soda to Edie Falco
and while we're watching people tear up
can seem incredible the techniques that
psychics use to achieve those moments

name:John Oliver

text:are significantly less incredible
because there are two basic techniques
that psychics tend to use the first is
called cold reading it's basically
taking high probability guesses like I'm
sensing a loved one who had problems in

name:John Oliver

text:the chest area or is there a J or an M
in a loved one's name here are some cold
reading in action alright
and is there in theat like a Daniel
David like there's a big D so for me
it's initials it's usually on months of

name:John Oliver

text:the year like December being important
who is the MRNA mark Mary Marie they
don't have to be past they could be here
in the physical world
you know Maureen Mary Ann there's an M
name where's the M connection to you

name:John Oliver

text:does someone have a scar and the bun of
foot I do thank you cuz your daddy is
telling me there's a scar on your foot
she departed of Alzheimer's or some type
of dementia or something of the brain
and that you had to make choices and

name:John Oliver

text:decisions connected to her departure did
anybody have either a brain tumor brain
aneurysm or a cerebral cerebral
hemorrhage not connected to him not
connected to you somebody behind you had
that Oh someone been under had that nice

name:John Oliver

text:save buddy interestingly often turns out
that a psychics wrong guess is just
energy from somewhere else in the room a
room incidentally that he's very likely
to have someone who had one of the
problems he just listed because

name:John Oliver

text:cerebrovascular diseases are the fifth
leading cause of death in the United
States it's like asking a roomful of
praying mantises has anybody here lost a
loved one because you ate them after
having sex you know all those little

name:John Oliver

text:green hands are going up
the secret of cold reading is the
broader the generality the higher the
chance it resonates with someone it is
the same reason that fortune cookies
predict romantic developments ahead and

name:John Oliver

text:not your wife is gonna seem icy
withholding around the 12th of the month
that's because when she asked you to
handle the thing with the grout in the
shower she didn't mean be the plumbers
point of contact we keep abreast of

name:John Oliver

text:every step of the grouting process she
meant she wanted it off her plate and
she just feels like text in the middle
of the work day asking if she thinks the
landlord is gonna ask her the plumbers
insurance that's the off her plate

name:John Oliver

text:that's just new air and filling up the
plate instead of the plumber does that
make sense
Aaron it's not the garbage disposal
installation all over again lucky
numbers 8 14 and 23 and sometimes

name:John Oliver

text:psychics may make laughably sure bets
for instance here's John Edward in
Huntington Long Island a town where
nearly 1 in 5 residents are of Irish
ancestry is there a Brian Flanagan or a
Flynn or O'Sullivan or O'Reilly or some

name:John Oliver

text:type of whose past Brian Oh something
Flanagan Sullivan something like that
what are you doing Brian Flanagan or Oh
Flynn or Oh something he's supposed to
be speaking directly to people's dead
relatives not trying to guess the name

name:John Oliver

text:of the Lucky Charms mascot for the
record that leprechauns name ibrahim
abdul hameed been selling if that
surprises you maybe update you
antiquated Irish stereotypes
and once a psychic has you on the hook

name:John Oliver

text:they use your responses as well as
nonverbal cues that you may be giving
them to make narrower and narrower
guesses until you are amazed at what
they've just done of course it's not an
exact science it's not a science at all

name:John Oliver

text:and sometimes things do go wrong in fact
let's pick up John addresses reading
with the family of Bryan Oh something as
he doubles down on a bad guess I'm kind
of getting the feeling of not liking the
older female like not liking the mother

name:John Oliver

text:figure so if you tell me that you didn't
like you're his father's mother then I
would understand that I don't think I do
I don't think I do
I just want to be really clear because I
can't tell you what you want to hear I'm

name:John Oliver

text:gonna tell you what they're showing me
and if he's calling your mother a bitch
I'm gonna pass them on so what you want
about John Edward he's sticking to his
guns there none of that maybe this bitch
energy is coming from somewhere else in

name:John Oliver

text:the room nonsense this time no no this
time he chooses to go for it yeah Bryan
thinks grandma's a bitch and you know
what so do I now in fact hang on Amelia
Earhart just came through and she just
called grandma the c-word so don't be

name:John Oliver

text:mad with me be mad at Amelia Earhart
cold reading is basically just a magic
trick and yet prominent smart people are
willing to co-sign on psychics abilities
a few years ago Tyler Henry the
Hollywood medium and anime drawing of

name:John Oliver

text:Jared Kushner went on The Today Show to
do a reading of one of their anchors and
I'm afraid it's the exact Today Show
anchor that you are hoping slash
dreading it is there's a reference to
fishing but he's talking about being

name:John Oliver

text:spoken out loud to I know what this is
actually I don't know if you're aware of
this but he's acknowledging an
individual will be out on a boat and
it's like I'm sitting alone and I'm
fishing and I'm thinking that and he's

name:John Oliver

text:having me acknowledge this feeling of
like I'm there with you I'm there with
you um you know my dad shared two
passions with me he shared golf and
fishing night
and I do go out fish a lot alone on a

name:John Oliver

text:boat and this idea that that that might
be a time to communicate with him or
that he is attempting to communicate is
phenomenal to me yeah phenomenal it's
clear that Matt Lauer is touched there
and this time he didn't even have to

name:John Oliver

text:press were subordinate into doing it
maybe Tyler Henry just took a shot that
an older straight white male was upwards
of lukewarm toward fishing if he did
that would be cold reading but he may
have been using the other technique here

name:John Oliver

text:of hot reading which involves doing
prior research on a subject so for
instance he could have read articles
where Lauer talks about his father's
passion for fishing or seen interviews
little hour gave like this one my dad

name:John Oliver

text:taught me had a fish when I stand in a
trout stream now and I've got the waders
on and I've got a fly rod in my hand or
I'm fishing for bass I think about
sitting in a boat with my dad look
maybe Tyler Henry genuinely accessed the

name:John Oliver

text:afterlife an action which would
fundamentally change our understanding
of everything on earth or maybe he just
googled Matt Lauer dad and hit the
 jackpot so so to recap hot
reading researching people beforehand

name:John Oliver

text:the even lazier skill than cold reading
which basically involves
indiscriminately shouting the names of
dead Irishmen in a hotel ballroom and
what's surprising is whichever technique
Tyler used Lauer fell for it and he is

name:John Oliver

text:smart he's a sophisticated Manhattan sex
monster but he fell for it
hard so hard he wanted to make it clear
to the viewers at home that this was way
more than just your standard TV
I tell you got home I cried I did plenty

name:John Oliver

text:of crying when I got home it's amazing
we want to let you know season two of
Hollywood medium with Tyler Hannah it
almost seems weird to be doing it as a
promo right now because it was so much
more important to me than a promo it

name:John Oliver

text:premieres Wednesday August 10th on our
sister network e well everything about
that is a little strange not least the
fact that it is weird to envision a
scenario in which something happened at
the Today Show offices and then Matt

name:John Oliver

text:Lauer was the one who went home and
cried
look you can see why people are
vulnerable to psychics
a message from a lost loved one is
something many people in the midst of

name:John Oliver

text:grief would do anything for and psychics
may tell themselves that they offer a
harmless way to deal with painful loss
in fact just watch as Theresa Caputo
pretty much spells that out in response
to a fairly obvious question so when a

name:John Oliver

text:tragedy happens let's say a murder if
somebody comes to a loved one and the
spirit of the person who was murdered is
there could that spirit potentially tell
you who did it they will acknowledge
maybe the relationship but never will

name:John Oliver

text:call someone out on the name why is that
my thing how I use my gift is I only
want messages that I got to help someone
for the healing process oh come on first
to be clear if I was murdered I would
definitely name names as a ghost it's

name:John Oliver

text:not like one of the rules in heaven is
go snitches get go stitches as we all
know the only rule in heaven is no
 the clouds seriously it's a real
problem up there and to be fair I'll get
it they're so fluffy and you might say

name:John Oliver

text:at this point hold on where is the
downside in telling people their
grandmother loved them but I would argue
that at best it is reckless for a
stranger to take a stab at ventral
acquiring the dead loss is complicated

name:John Oliver

text:and mourning doesn't look the same for
everyone but at worst when psychic
abilities are presented as authentic it
emboldened a vast underworld of
unscrupulous vultures more than happy to
make money by offering an open line to

name:John Oliver

text:the afterlife as well as many other
 services take Rose marks she
ran a lucrative psychic ring and in 2014
went to prison for defrauding clients of
more than 17 million dollars much of
which came from best-selling author Judy

name:John Oliver

text:burrow who marks had promised to
reconnect with her dead son and the sick
thing is parents in crisis are
frequently actively targeted by psychics
at their most desperate moments John and
Joann lowitz er have been searching for

name:John Oliver

text:their 17 year old daughter Ally since
she vanished last year but when the case
made national news
the Houston parents say they became
inundated with calls from so-called
psychic detectives they say some even

name:John Oliver

text:showed up at their front door promising
their psychic visions could help bring
Ally home he guaranteed me they need to
find Ally in three days and what parent
wouldn't be excited to hear that you're
gonna have your daughter home in three

name:John Oliver

text:days that is absolutely horrible because
the last thing any parent needs in that
situation is having to fend off an
attention-seeking parasite who feeds off
personal tragedy like a human sized deer
tick and the problem is TV actively

name:John Oliver

text:enables that ghoulish nurse the Montel
Williams Show regularly featured Sylvia
Browne a well-known psychic
who advised parents with missing
children on how to locate their kids on
one episode she advised the mother of

name:John Oliver

text:Amanda berry a missing child who had
been kidnapped now a man that was
actually alive and watching that episode
from captivity and after she eventually
escaped she talked about how watching it
had felt I would watch her every time

name:John Oliver

text:she was on Montone I say I wish my mom
would go in there and then she could
tell my mom that I was alive and then
I'm okay she but Sylvia Browne breaks
Luana's home I just hate this she's not
alive

name:John Oliver

text:I just broke down crying because I
couldn't believe she said that and that
hurt even worse that is heartbreaking
and Sylvia Browne is clearly an awful
person for doing that but I would argue
that Montel also bears some blame for

name:John Oliver

text:giving Browne a platform to begin with
put it this way if Oprah interviewed a
live alligator and it ate four members
of her audience I'd be angry with the
alligator but it'd also be kind of angry
with Oprah Sylvia Browne actually died a

name:John Oliver

text:few years ago or did she
people have been wrong about that sort
of thing before maybe she's alive and
watching me refer to her as dead the one
thing I know for sure is that Montel
Williams his show is definitely deceased

name:John Oliver

text:but but but daytime shows are still
holding hands with this
just last month dr. Phil had a psychic
detective on to help solve a cold case
and why would he do that the only
logical explanation for letting a

name:John Oliver

text:professional guess awayin would be if
dr. Phil was actually the murderer and
he was trying to throw people off the
scent but apart from that explanation
that now makes a lot of sense there is
no explanation although I will say this

name:John Oliver

text:every now and then when handled
responsibly a psychic on television is a
delightful thing just watch this
spectacular local news investigation of
a psychic named Deborah Dominique who in
exchange for 160 dollars

name:John Oliver

text:met an undercover reporter at a Denny's
our producer met her at a coffee shop
saying she wants to know what happened
to Matthew the ten year old boy in this
photo
after staring at his photo she uses a

name:John Oliver

text:special pendulum claiming it allows her
to talk with the day and then she claims
she is connected directly with memory
but is he because we're pretty sure
Matthew the boy in this photo is not
wearing white or in heaven in fact we

name:John Oliver

text:know he's wearing black and is alive
because you're looking at him sitting in
the boat right behind her yep
that boy is indeed in the opposite of
heaven he's in a Denny's but wait wait
till you see exactly how they Buster

name:John Oliver

text:because it is just perfect I'm Curtis
coming from channel 13 how are you
showing her the picture of Matthew she
tells me she thinks he was taken I
understand you said you thought he was
deceased yes I believe he could be I've

name:John Oliver

text:got news for you it might come as a
shock but he's very much alive oh that's
great he's actually standing right
behind you right now
it is great it is great it's utter
perfection the only way that could have

name:John Oliver

text:been any better is if the first thing
that kids said to her was hey mom and I
would argue that that is the only
responsible way to put a psychic on
television humiliating them with a ghost
boy in a Denny's parking lot because

name:John Oliver

text:this surprisingly large often predatory
industry relies on popular culture to
lend it credence and validity to put it
another way every time a psychic makes a
grieving widow cry on dr. oz 10 con
artists get their wings and that is a

name:John Oliver

text:problem because there will always be
people who feel an urge to reach out to
psychics in their time of need
so if you or someone you know is one of
them I may have a small way to help here
sadly this isn't really the best format

name:John Oliver

text:for me to show you so please join me on
the set of my new daytime talk show
instead
welcome back to wakey-wakey with John
Oliver it's some time between 9:00 and
3:00 in the afternoon then but my next

name:John Oliver

text:guest is a Staten Island psychic and
author of the book these freaking
spirits let me tell you please welcome
Wonder Joe Oliver
thank you for having me John thank you
it's lovely to have you here now Wanda

name:John Oliver

text:if you look familiar to some viewers it
might be because you're also my beloved
wife I'm it's freaking angel she is no
quick question Wanda Joe what happened
to your accent are you from the south
I'm not from there anymore that makes

name:John Oliver

text:sense no wonder when did you first
realize that you had incredible psychic
abilities oh well it was right after I
saw a thing on TV about how much money
psychics can make and suddenly I was
like me too

name:John Oliver

text:hashtag me too oh no no no that's that's
not that's actually a different year my
gift with the world no Joe I understand
that you've graciously offered to give
our viewers psychic readings for free
bingo bango as part of a court-ordered

name:John Oliver

text:settlement I've been forced to set up a
website Wanda Jo the free psychic calm
just log on now and you can get a
breathing for me Wanda joke just like
this okay they want me to acknowledge an
EM connection that could mean Mark or

name:John Oliver

text:Mary or Megan it could be someone who's
passed or still alive it also doesn't
have to be a name it could be any word
that starts with M or has an M somewhere
in it maybe maybe Museum Oh hamper it
could be an upside down and like a W or

name:John Oliver

text:sideways then like a three or an E
anyway that person he or she wants me to
tell you that the time you had together
was really special to him or her wow
that is phenomenal to me and it almost
seems weird to be doing this as a promo

name:John Oliver

text:right now because wonder gave me a
reading yesterday and it was so much
more important to me than a promo I
cried all the way home I told them none
of his dead relatives wanted to talk to
him that's that's so then the point is

name:John Oliver

text:go to wonder Joe the free psychic or
medium impressive calm and get a free
psychic reading we promise it will be
exactly as accurate as any psychic
reading that you would pay money for
oh wait wait I'm getting a voice through

name:John Oliver

text:for someone at home hold on your
grandmother's a bitch Wow
[Applause]
Europe you know that thing Belgium is in
if if you've watched the news at all
lately you cannot have missed what has

name:John Oliver

text:been happening there Europe's migrant
crisis is getting worse by the day
migrant crisis spiraling out of control
hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers
are risking everything a human wave
washing over Europe southern shores

name:John Oliver

text:hundreds of thousands of migrants have
streamed into Europe the largest influx
there since the end of World War two Wow
the largest since the end of World War
two and remember millions of people back
then were searching both for a better

name:John Oliver

text:life and for the booth where it was
rumored you could slap dead Hitler and
look the scale of this story can be hard
to get your head around hundreds of
thousands of people are on the move just
within Europe and another four million

name:John Oliver

text:are being hosted in Turkey Lebanon and
Jordan and when numbers get that high
that can be hard to comprehend it's like
when someone tells you the size of the
audience of NCIS New Orleans 17 million
people how's that even possible

name:John Oliver

text:how many Navy based crimes could there
possibly be in New Orleans this doesn't
make any sense and when you are dealing
with a mass of people that large you
only want to be a little careful with
how you describe them unfortunately

name:John Oliver

text:David Cameron noted alleged swine
fellatio enthusiast recently referred to
a swarm of people coming across the
Mediterranean and that language matters
because a swarm of anything sounds
terrifying

name:John Oliver

text:no matter what it is if I hear there are
a lot of kittens coming my way I'm going
to be delighted but if I hear there is a
swarm of kittens approaching I'm
grabbing a shotgun and I'm getting to
high ground because I'm not going to let

name:John Oliver

text:those furry take me alive
and here in the US some in the media
have chosen to reduce the migrant
population to one simple stereotype a
new video surfaces online showing why
some are worried Europe is opening its

name:John Oliver

text:doors to potential terrorists those are
reportedly Muslim refugees on a train in
Europe chanting Allah Akbar or God is
great now to be clear we're not saying
that any of those people are terrorists
or in any way affiliated with a terror

name:John Oliver

text:group but it does highlight just how
many of these refugees who are fleeing
violence in Iraq and Syria are Muslim
okay okay first you don't get to claim
that you're not calling those people
terrorists when your lower third says

name:John Oliver

text:terrorists inbound question mark if you
are really not saying they're terrorists
maybe change that to something more
accurate like people take train or some
wear hats others less so
and second describing that as a new

name:John Oliver

text:video that sheds light on the migrant
crisis is a little misleading because in
researching this story we found a
version of that same video uploaded onto
YouTube
back in 2010 well before this migrant

name:John Oliver

text:crisis even began and if you are going
to use misleading old footage to try and
make people frightened of Muslims why
stop there just go the whole way and use
a clip from True Lies now to be clear
we're not saying that any of those

name:John Oliver

text:people are terrorists or in any way
affiliated with a terror group but it
does highlight just how many of these
refugees who are fleeing violence in
Iraq
that's something about 10% more racist

name:John Oliver

text:than what you did so let's just take a
step back because for the record these
people are coming from many different
countries and fleeing everything from
civil war to economic stagnation and
while each story is unique many of them

name:John Oliver

text:are heartbreaking
no Gina 16 and from kobani in Syria
disabled from birth she cannot walk and
made the dangerous crossing from Turkey
last week for the first time during this
journey like a train and then a ship so

name:John Oliver

text:you enjoyed it yeah you're the first
person I've met who said that but to
understand why you must know the world
she escaped from at any minute what is
your dream to go out and find an alien
yes so I wanna meet the Queen oh I think

name:John Oliver

text:that girl absolutely deserves to meet an
alien and the Queen and also if she has
time a real human with feelings
but unfortunately for Najib and so many
like her Europe has yet to create an
effective system to process this influx

name:John Oliver

text:of people every country has a different
application process and some are totally
overwhelmed and underfunded we actually
got our hands on a couple of
registration forms that were given to
refugees upon arrival this one was

name:John Oliver

text:handed to a Syrian asylum seeker
arriving in Greece on September the 5th
it tells him to return for registration
on December the 21st and that could be a
tricky three-month wait because he's not
allowed to work in that time and yet

name:John Oliver

text:that is nothing compared to this form
given to an Iraqi refugee in Turkey
telling him to come back on June 15th of
2017 which sounds bad before you notice
the pink sticky notes added at the
bottom clarifying that his actual date

name:John Oliver

text:will be February 19th 2020 and that is
ridiculous these people can't go 5 years
without working there refugees
Renee Zellweger I'm facing that kind of
limbo
it's no wonder refugees want to try to

name:John Oliver

text:push deeper into Europe and many of them
are heading for one surprising country
in particular that seems to actually
want them they keep coming thousands
every day at the main train station in
Munich often greeted by applauding

name:John Oliver

text:locals or welcoming volunteers it's no
wonder that Germany is the preferred
destination for so many refugees that's
right amazingly one of the warmest
welcomes on offer to immigrants comes
from Germany a country whose idea of a

name:John Oliver

text:bedtime story is two children being left
to die in the forest before being nearly
cooked and eaten and then murdering an
old woman sleep well unfortunately many
politicians in other countries in
Germany have been actively hostile to

name:John Oliver

text:anyone even considering settling within
their borders no way you will not make
the Netherlands how please don't come
it's risky to come we can't guarantee
that you will be accepted here the
Danish government has published these

name:John Oliver

text:ads in a number of Lebanese newspapers
the text is obviously written in Arabic
and it's telling migrants don't come to
Denmark highlighting the tough
regulations and constraints that await
them there that's right

name:John Oliver

text:Denmark is so averse to taking people in
it's basically placing intentionally
missed connections ads in other
countries me Danish government official
you person in a Lebanese refugee camp
from the moment I saw you I knew there

name:John Oliver

text:was nothing between us and it could
never work perfect send but even
Denmark's approach seems friendly next
to the video apparently produced by the
mayor of a sheet aalam in Hungary
showing exactly how he and his police

okay okay a few things there first you

name:John Oliver

text:can add as much scary music as you want
there is nothing imposing about one van
drive to get load on a country road the
only message that that is sending to
migrants is make sure you wait for that
one van to pass by and second of all mr.

and nightclub bouncers are not the same
thing right you look like you're about
to throw someone out of Hungary because
they didn't bring enough hot girls with
them and that mayor is no outlier

text:hungary has been responsible for some of
the ugliest mistreatment of refugees in
europe disturbing cell phone video
appears to show migrants at the main
refugee camp here being fed like a herd
of caged animals in a holding pen it's a

text:shocking video that has garnered
attention from around the world as waves
of desperate migrants sprint from a
holding camp in Hungary a camera woman
appears to trip a man running with his
child in his arms the woman also kicks

name:John Oliver

text:other migrants as they run including a
young girl now the camera woman is out
of a job oh I'm sorry she lost her job
that's absolutely terrible don't worry
I'm sure she can find a new one on
actual monster.com

name:John Oliver

text:to be fair she later apologized saying
I'm not a heartless racist children
kicking camerawoman
which I can only presume means she's a
loving accepting children kicking
camerawoman

name:John Oliver

text:because the children kicking part is not
really up for debate anymore and even
those countries who are offering to take
refugees are sometimes making those
offers in the most insulting Lea
selectively like Devaki ins saying that

name:John Oliver

text:they're only going to give asylum to two
Christians they don't want Muslims
migrants coming into the country Muslim
asylum seekers not least because they
haven't got any mosques I'm sorry

trash human garbage that doesn't want to
work human garbage those are some pretty
strong words coming from the Polish Six

name:John Oliver

text:Flags guy and what what he said is not
just offensive it's also wrong research
has shown that while there is some small
cost in the short term eventually an
influx of lower-wage immigrants into a
community tends to raise wages for

name:John Oliver

text:everyone else and a working paper
published last year by four economists
found that immigration benefited local
populations in 19 of the 20
industrialized countries they study and
think about that

name:John Oliver

text:adding immigrants makes things better 19
times out of
that's a success rate matched only by
bacon and paul rudd and incidentally
it's it's just a little hard to hear
these migrants and refugees being called

name:John Oliver

text:lazy considering how hard many of them
have worked to reach Europe in the first
place you really want to talk about lazy
migrants I'm a lazy migrant I left a
country by airplane and the only things
I was escaping were fog public a

name:John Oliver

text:difference and an almost certain future
as the turtle of Prince Harry's
entourage is Europe doesn't even need to
do this for good reasons it can do it
for selfish ones because as a continent
it is in dire need of new citizens

name:John Oliver

text:according to the UN the average woman
needs to have 2.1 children to maintain
the population of a developed country
but in the European Union every single
country is below that 2.1 level by 2050
some countries like Greece Portugal and

name:John Oliver

text:Germany will see their populations drop
by double-digit percentages according to
Pew that's true if Europe doesn't open
its doors to more migrants this is not
the changing face of Europe they should
be frightened of this is this one right

name:John Oliver

text:here and look not every single asylum
seeker is going to be the perfect
economic wellspring but instead of
worrying about the hypothetical downside
of letting these migrants in country
should be more worried about the actual

name:John Oliver

text:downside of turning them away if for no
other reason that you might miss out on
someone like Najim who seems like she
would improve any country that would
have her just listen to how she taught
herself English

name:John Oliver

text:at home with my favorite TV show
days of our lives whether you just
struggle love them both how could you
not want this girl in your country she
like came to our lives and specifically
she loves EJ and Sami in fact even after

name:John Oliver

text:weeks of total hell mortal danger and
inhumane treatment the jeans biggest
complaint is that the show actually
killed off EJ who was her favorite
character and frankly she's right to be
upset

name:John Oliver

text:EJ and Sami were magic together I mean
yes you could argue that EJ basically
blackmailed Sammy into marriage and then
impregnated her and then worked for
Sammy's arch-nemesis Nicole Walker who
he then also impregnated and then he

name:John Oliver

text:kidnapped Sammy's baby and made her
think it was dead so Sammy shot him in
their head but you know what that's the
kind of thing couples do and besides
they got through all that and yes yes
sure EJ did then cheat on Sammy before

name:John Oliver

text:their wedding with that trollop at
abigaile Deveraux but but he still
didn't deserve to die from yet another
gunshot wound even though yes it was a
best reckless for him to have a secret
meeting with hillbilly drug lord close

name:John Oliver

text:Western in the middle of the
woods EJ how could you go you and Sammy
were so close to eternal happiness why
AJ why why EJ my point is my point is
my point is magine has been through
enough and any country would be lucky to

name:John Oliver

text:have her and I know lots of people still
have fears fears that migrants will
bankrupt social systems which many
studies show does not happen fears that
migrants might have an Isis member
lurking among them which there has been

name:John Oliver

text:no credible example of and no one is
saying this is easy but the fact is so
hard is not a reason to do less it's a
reason to do more from countries
expediting their application process to
properly funding the UN High Commission

name:John Oliver

text:for Refugees whose fund for responding
to Syrian refugees in neighboring
countries is less than half of where it
needs to be to simply and I know this
sounds crazy just not kicking them when
they're moving around and that's a crazy

name:John Oliver

text:idea
just raelia lagging and then there is
actually one final thing that we thought
we could do and it is admittedly very
small and it is just for one refugee but
for Najim who was so justifiably

name:John Oliver

our lives
we made some calls and we have a
surprise that is literally just for you

those migrants are going through it's
the same $1,000 to bribe your way onto
rubber dinghy and that's how you get

[Music]
you
our top story tonight concerns the
internet aka the electronic cat database

name:John Oliver

text:but first let's take just a moment
together and appreciate how amazing the
internet is you can use it to file your
taxes apply for jobs you can go online
right now and buy a case of coyote urine
do you know how difficult it used to be

name:John Oliver

text:to obtain coyote on you literally had to
give a coyote Gatorade and just wait it
was a mess the system was a mess but but
if you've turned on the news lately you
may have heard some worrying references
to the Internet

name:John Oliver

text:changing the Federal Communications
Commission is agreed to move forward on
a proposal it could change the way we
use the Internet at risk the basic
principle of net neutrality net
neutrality is Rowdy yes

name:John Oliver

text:net neutrality the only two words that
promise more boredom in the English
language are featuring sting pairing
people talk about it is somehow even
worse as anticipated that notice
proposes to ground the net neutrality

name:John Oliver

text:rules in Section 706 of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 oh my god
that is the most boring thing I've ever
seen that is even boring by c-span
standards I would rather read a book by
Thomas Friedman than sit through that

name:John Oliver

text:hearing I would rather listen to a pair
of Dockers tell me about the weird dream
it had I would rather sit down with my
niece and watch car you a children's
show about a bald Canadian child who
lives a life devoid of any incident boo

name:John Oliver

text:Caillou
and leave the house find out what the
worlds are boots come on but here's the
thing
net neutrality is actually hugely
important essentially it means that all

name:John Oliver

text:data has to be treated equally no matter
who creates it it's why the Internet is
a weirdly level playing field and
startups can supplant established brands
that's how Facebook supplanted MySpace
which supplanted Friendster which

name:John Oliver

text:supplanted actually having any friends
do you remember physically having
friends it was awful
you couldn't tap people's faces to make
them go away but the point is the
Internet in its current form is not

name:John Oliver

text:broken and the FCC is currently taking
steps to fix that the FCC is endorsing
new rules that could clear the way for
it to tear system the rules would open
the door for the first time for internet
providers like Comcast and Verizon to

name:John Oliver

text:charge tech companies to send content to
consumers more quickly Netflix for
example might pay a premium to ensure
that its customers can stream movies
more reliably at a cost a start-up
competitor might not be able to afford

name:John Oliver

text:no this cannot happen how else is my
startup streaming video service nut
flicks going to compete it's going to be
America's one-stop resource for videos
of men getting hit in the nuts you don't
even know you want it yet that's why

name:John Oliver

text:it's brilliant ending net neutrality
would allow big companies to buy their
way into the fast lane leaving everyone
else in the slow lane
although telecom companies would prefer
that you put it in a slightly different

name:John Oliver

text:way when you say fast lane in slow lane
it's a good illustration but what you
really should be talking about is a fast
lane for everybody and a hyperspeed lane
for others
if we let cable companies offer to speed

name:John Oliver

text:of service they won't be Usain Bolt and
Usain Bolt
on a motorbike they'll be Usain Bolt and
Usain Bolt egde to an anchor and telecom
companies will say they would never slow
down a website speed in order to get

name:John Oliver

text:more money out of them but but let me
tell you a little story recently Comcast
was negotiating with Netflix
this graph shows Netflix download speeds
on various providers that black line
plummeting downwards was their speed on

name:John Oliver

text:Comcast during the negotiation see if
you can guess when Netflix agreed to
Comcast demands I'll give you a hint
it's right there that has all the
ingredients of a mob shakedown Netflix
does show about life in a ladies prison

name:John Oliver

text:such a shame if there was going to be
something happen to your connection area
so frustrating that would be
it's not just anti corporate hippies who
think that abandoning net neutrality is
a bad idea the net neutrality movement

name:John Oliver

text:is leery of big corporate players but in
this debate it's on the same side as
some of them Google Facebook Netflix
Amazon all signed onto this letter
supporting net neutrality what's being
proposed is so egregious activists and

name:John Oliver

text:corporations have been forced onto the
same side that's basically Lex Luthor
knocking on Superman's Apartment door
and going listen I know we have our
differences but we have got to get rid
of that asshole in apartment 3b he's

name:John Oliver

text:he's too loud soup he's just too loud
and you might wonder well look if
everyone is against this how is it even
possibly happening or consider who would
benefit from this change cable companies
Verizon wants a two-tier system so badly

name:John Oliver

text:they sued the government to force the
rule change that's currently being
discussed these companies have
Washington in their pockets to a
conveniently almost unbelievable degree
comcast has spent 18 million eight

name:John Oliver

text:hundred ten thousand dollars in lobbying
last year it's more than any other
company for defense contractor north of
chromatin so just to be clear the
ranking of who boys government influence
is number one military-industrial

name:John Oliver

text:complex and number two the provider of
Lizard Lick towing I could show you the
troublingly cozy relationship between
cable companies in Washington in any
number of ways I could show you the
president golfing with the CEO of

name:John Oliver

text:Comcast or saying at a fundraiser at a
cable executives house that he'd been
there so many times the only thing I
haven't done in this house is have Seder
dinner but but perhaps the most succeed
way is this the president has picked Tom

name:John Oliver

text:wheeler a former top lobbyist for cable
and wireless companies to be the next
chair of the Federal Communications
Commission yes the guy who used to run
the cable industry's lobbying arm is now
running the agency tasked with

name:John Oliver

text:regulating it that is the equivalent of
needing a babysitter and hiring a dingo
here thanks for stopping over
like make sure they're in bed by 8:00
there's 20 bucks on the table for kibble
so please don't eat my baby with the

name:John Oliver

text:fact with the fact that they are
practically overseeing their own
oversight it is hardly surprising that
cable companies are basically monopolies
now a federal study found that 96
percent of the population had access to

name:John Oliver

text:two or fewer cable broadband providers
it's almost as if they've agreed to stay
out of each other's way like drug
cartels but hold on hold on oh that's
not fair that's not fair I mean if
hypothetically a cable company like

name:John Oliver

text:Comcast were planning to merge with a
company like let's say Time Warner it's
not like their CEO would sit down and
Mark out who had which turf right but in
video and in broadband we don't compete
with Time Warner you have to start with

name:John Oliver

text:that very fundamental point there in New
York we're in Philadelphia they're in LA
we're in San Francisco you can't buy a
Comcast in New York you can't buy a Time
Warner in Philadelphia so there's no
reduction in competition exactly you

name:John Oliver

text:can't reduce competition when nobody is
competing you could not be describing a
monopoly more clearly if you are wearing
a metal top hat while driving a metal
car after winning second prize in a
beauty contest

name:John Oliver

text:maybe it's because of their lack of
competition they get away with providing
such shitty service we pay more for our
internet service than almost anybody
else on earth and yet the download
speeds we get lag behind Estonia Estonia

name:John Oliver

text:a country where from the looks of it
they still worried about Shrek attacks
is it any wonder that in in a massive
recent customer satisfaction surveys
Comcast and Time Warner Cable came in
dead last and when you look at the

name:John Oliver

text:companies that were scored better than
them people were basically saying yes
Bank of America took my home yes Taco
Bell gave me diarrhea and sure GM tried
to kill me Time Warner and Comcast are
the worst

name:John Oliver

text:they are the new us
[Music]
I know I know
the cable companies will say oh they
support net neutrality protections or
they remain committed to the open

name:John Oliver

text:Internet or just the tip but let me
remind you
they also say that they'll be at your
house between 2:00 and 6:00 tomorrow
afternoon there's any part of you really
expect them to intern up and yet our

name:John Oliver

text:government looks set to end net
neutrality and let these companies run
hog wild and we're just going to let
them and you know why it all comes back
to this it seeks comment on ways to
construe additional language in section

name:John Oliver

text:706 and even suggests using section 230
B to broaden the scope of the
Commission's usurped authority oh my god
how are you still so dull and that's the
problem the cable companies have figured
out the great truth of America if you

name:John Oliver

text:want to do something evil put it inside
something boring Apple could put the
entire text of mine camp inside the
iTunes User Agreement and you just go
agree agree agree agree that's why
should not be talking about protecting

name:John Oliver

text:net neutrality they shouldn't even use
that phrase they should call it
preventing cable company factoring
because that is what it is and it might
actually compel people to want to do
something and the interesting thing here

name:John Oliver

text:is there might actually be something you
can still do the FCC will be taking
public comment for 120 days that's right
the FCC are literally inviting internet
comments at this address
and at this point and I can't believe

name:John Oliver

text:I'm about to do this I would like to
address the internet commenters out
there directly
good evening monsters this may be the

thank you so much for joining us and let
us begin with our first and only story
the 2016 election or as you may know it
I thought I wanted it to be over but now
that it's over I wish it was still going

name:John Oliver

text:on because it turns out the ending is
even worse twenty 16 the results
Oh Tuesday what we're a little different
than what just over half the voters
wanted we can now project the winner the
presidential race CNN projects Donald

name:John Oliver

text:Trump wins the presidency Donald J Trump
will become the 45th President of the
United States it's true that happened it
turns out instead of showing our
daughters that they could someday be
president America proved that no grandpa

name:John Oliver

text:is too racists to become leader of the
free world look papa someday that could
be you now if you're like me the
implications of this have been hitting
you in waves one minute you're none and
the next minute you realize that Donald

name:John Oliver

text:Trump this man will soon have access to
the nuclear codes and then maybe you get
distracted by daily life until it hits
you again
o our future president was supported by
a former Grand Wizard of the Klan and 60

name:John Oliver

text:million people voted for him despite
that and then maybe you finally managed
to get some sleep but then you wake up
realizing oh the Supreme Court
because remember Merrick garland who the
Republicans have refused to confirm all

name:John Oliver

text:year you know the guy whom we asked you
to choose a Supreme Court dog for you
you actually picked this one by the way
what we never announced it because we
figured that we would tell you when he
was confirmed well he's not getting

name:John Oliver

text:confirmed and that dog is dead now look
actually not really she she is fine but
she's not getting on the court Donald
Trump will fill that seat and maybe more
Ruth Bader Ginsburg is in her aid
Anthony Kennedy is is over 80 and there

name:John Oliver

text:are other justices who've talked bandied
about the idea of retiring bottom line
Donald Trump is going to shape the
Supreme Court for decades to come
Wow that is one of those phrases you've
just assumed you would never have to

name:John Oliver

text:hear like vanilla rice is picking up his
Nobel Prize in Physics or Henry
Kissinger just came out with a line of
skinny jeans they go with everything now
it has been wave after wave of nausea
all week I woke up on Thursday feeling

name:John Oliver

text:fractionally better but then I turned on
the TV and saw Trump in the Oval Office
with President Obama and just look at
the president's face there he cannot
believe what he's looking at either in
fact just listen to the actual audio in

name:John Oliver

text:that room compact that is the new
national anthem now
you see we're laughing we're having fun
and then you remember Trump's going to
be in charge of the military and leaders
there do not know what to expect they

name:John Oliver

text:have seen Donald Trump's statements on
the campaign trail talking about
waterboarding talking about bombing with
little regard to civilian casualties
talking about taking the oil in Iraq all
of these things potentially very serious

name:John Oliver

text:violations of international law of
violations of the Geneva Convention
yes our president-elect has at various
times said he'd bomb civilians loot oil
and water board which isn't a military
strategy so much as the series of words

name:John Oliver

text:that Donald Rumsfeld mutters so he can
stay hard while he's masturbating and
look look
Trump won this election by which I mean
he won the electoral college which for
reasons I will never understand no

name:John Oliver

text:matter how many times it's explained to
me is how things are done and many
people it's important remember many
people are happy to see him in office
some are voters who think he'll bring
jobs back and shake up Washington others

name:John Oliver

text:are happy simply because he isn't
Hillary Clinton and others of course are
Vladimir Putin and Scott Baio
but for the rest of us we are faced with
these same questions as a guy that woke
up the day after a Vegas bachelor party

name:John Oliver

text:deep in the desert naked tied to a
cactus and a dead clown named Lee
how the did we get here and what
the do we do now because Donald
Trump will be president and respecting
democracy means accepting that although

name:John Oliver

text:there is one sentiment that I would
argue takes that a little too far the
man hasn't even been a president for a
day yet all right let's give him a
chance to be the president give Donald
Trump a chance we now have to give him a

name:John Oliver

text:chance and see how he's gonna govern the
American people should give him a chance
to government because if he succeeds we
succeed now in the broadest sense I get
that impulse hope for the best in the
face of very long odds it's like we're

name:John Oliver

text:on a plane and we just found out our
pilot is a wombat I don't like this I
don't understand how it happens
pretty sure we're headed for disaster
but what the hell come on batty prove me
wrong optimism optimism is nice if you

name:John Oliver

text:can swing it but you've got to be
careful because it can feed into the
normalization of Donald Trump and he is
not normal he is abnormal he's a human
what is wrong with this picture he
sticks out like a sore thumb and frankly

name:John Oliver

text:he even looks like a sore thumb so so
giving him a chance in the sense of not
speaking out immediately against
policies that he's proposed is dangerous
because some of them are alarming just
some of trumps promises repeal and

name:John Oliver

text:replace Obamacare build a wall along the
southern border with Mexico and get
Mexico to pay for said wall deport all
11 to 12 million undocumented immigrants
in this country including children
appoint a special prosecutor to

name:John Oliver

text:investigate and potentially jail Hillary
Clinton temporarily ban Muslims and
immigrants from terror prone nations
from coming into the United States okay
okay stop just stop because it sounds
like you're reading the to-do list on

name:John Oliver

text:Satan's refrigerator which of course
Satan no longer needs now that hell has
frozen over and while some are arguing
that Trump might not have meant all
those things that leaves us with two
devastating options either we just

name:John Oliver

text:elected a president who didn't mean a
single word he said or we elected one
who did and it's impossible to know
which one earlier tonight he did his
first major post-election interview and
he was asked about Obamacare which

name:John Oliver

text:remember he had labeled a disaster when
you replace it are you going to make
sure that people with preconditions are
still come yes because it happens to be
one of the strongest s you're gonna keep
also with the children living with their

name:John Oliver

text:parents for an extended period within it
you're gonna keep much try and keep that
oh okay
so get ready for a barely changed
version of Obamacare called Trump care
which sounds like a health care plan

name:John Oliver

text:where doctors feel your breasts for
lumps whether you ask them to or not
by the way don't get complacent that
he's going to keep those aspects of
Obamacare he might change his mind on
that again Trump is like a magic 8-ball

name:John Oliver

text:every time you shake him he gives you a
different answer and sometimes the
answer is just big-league or that's
somebody on my daughter right
so so we have to take all of trumps
promises seriously and the truth is they

name:John Oliver

text:were not all universally bad for
instance he ran on a promise to drain
the swamp cracking down on corruption
and ending the reign of Washington
insiders which sounds great so let's try
and be positive for a moment what are

name:John Oliver

text:the early signs on that some of the
potential cabinet members that are being
reported by CNN that are under
consideration Rudy Giuliani Newt
Gingrich chris Christie Reince Priebus
right so that's the longtime head of the

name:John Oliver

text:RNC a former speaker who entered
Congress in 1979 a former mayor turned
professional asshole and a man whose
name is synonymous with scandal who's
under rides that is so swampy
you're going to need to swap out Air

name:John Oliver

text:Force One for one of those shallow
bottom boats with a big fan on the back
and the thing is it actually makes sense
for Trump to appoint people with
significant experience in government
until a few days ago the highest office

name:John Oliver

text:he'd ever held was on the 26th floor of
a shitty building on Fifth Avenue but
some of the people he's bringing in are
horrifying his transition team includes
people like Ken Blackwell who has argued
that homosexuality is a choice and he's

name:John Oliver

text:named Myron Ebell to lead his EPA
transition team making him a frontrunner
for administrator
despite this the whole case for global
warming I believe is silly
and I believe the vast majority of

name:John Oliver

text:scientists think it's silly and
therefore I'm a little bit embarrassed
that I waste my time on a silly issue
okay well just first of all the vast
majority of scientists believe humans
are contributing to climate change and

name:John Oliver

text:secondly this man does not have a
science degree he wouldn't even be
qualified to head the agency of baking
soda volcanoes
so how the did we get here well
clearly there are many possible answers

name:John Oliver

text:to that question
including misleading forecasts that bred
complacency a flawed candidate who
failed to appeal to white rule and
working-class voters and and this is
worth repeating deep racism and/or

name:John Oliver

text:indifference to it and for those
including us who were shocked by Tuesday
we're gonna be examining all of these
four years but for tonight let's look at
just one narrow element that may have
helped bring us here because it will be

name:John Oliver

text:important going forward and that is on
media specifically how a system that is
supposed to catch a serial liar failed
and I'm not just referring to mainstream
TV news although some did wait far too
long to take Trump seriously giving him

name:John Oliver

text:billions of dollars worth of free media
at CNN for instance sometimes ran his
speeches almost in their entirety and
their president Jeff Zucker now admits
that might not have been such a great
idea I'd say that if we made a mistake

name:John Oliver

text:last year it's that we probably did put
on too many of his campaign rallies in
the in those early months you know
unedited and just let them run and I
think in hindsight we probably shouldn't
have done that as much yeah it turns out

name:John Oliver

text:hindsight much like the year we're all
now desperately looking forward to is
2020 and that is that is not to say that
there wasn't some great coverage of
Trump in this election from outlets like
the Washington Post and The New York

name:John Oliver

text:Times even CNN
eventually pivoted and began correcting
Trump in lower-third graphics such as
Trump I never said Japan should have
nukes parentheses he did and that is
good journalism if I gave a speech

name:John Oliver

text:saying on the sexiest man alive it would
be fair to tag that with parentheses
look at him now that's that's a mean
joke to laugh at but the problem is
the problem is the impact of Corrections
like that which may have sunk a

name:John Oliver

text:candidate in another era was compromised
because there is no longer a consensus
of what a fact is trust in mainstream
media outlets has been falling and
people can choose to get their news from
echo chambers that validate their views

name:John Oliver

text:and there is nothing inherently wrong
with media that has a viewpoint this
show has a viewpoint we fact check
everything we say but I don't pretend to
be neutral on things like criminal
justice reform and for it coldplay I'm

name:John Oliver

text:against it
or dEWALT's ladders they're a seamless
blend of style and performance walking
up one is like ascending to heaven on a
golden cloud I'm not being paid to say
that I'm just a fan but a healthy media

name:John Oliver

text:diet has to be broader than that and
unfortunately the way that many of us
can see news now is micro-targeted the
majority of Americans 62 percent say
they get their news from social media
according to Pew Research 44 percent of

name:John Oliver

text:all adults say they get news
specifically from Facebook that's true
news is now one of the three things that
we get from social media the other two
being our entire sense of self-worth and
pictures of shaved alpacas and and fake

name:John Oliver

text:facts circulate on social media to a
frightening extent you may have seen
this quote from Donald Trump online
about Republicans being dumb he never
said that
it's not true just as it's not true that

name:John Oliver

text:the Pope endorsed Trump because of
course he didn't but that story was
shared almost a million times which is
absurd everybody knows the candidate the
Pope endorsed was Joe exotic they have
very similar views on deregulating Tiger

name:John Oliver

text:preserves please share this news a
million times but there is now a whole
cottage industry specializing in
hyper-partisan sometimes wildly
distorted clickbait at BuzzFeed news
research sites like addicting info on

name:John Oliver

text:the left and a freedom daily on the
right both of which have over a million
followers on Facebook putting them in
the same range as Anderson Cooper 360
and found that some of them were
publishing many viral articles

name:John Oliver

text:containing flat-out falsehoods over two
weeks 38% of news on some
republican-leaning Facebook pages was
part
li or completely false compared to 19
percent of news shared on some Democrat

name:John Oliver

text:leaning Facebook pages yeah and before
you say well Republicans are twice as
bad
19 percent is still terrible and it is
not news that there is misinformation on
Facebook just look at the relationship

name:John Oliver

text:status it's complicated the accurate
version of that will clearly be in three
weeks I'll be single but I can't admit
it yet
but these sites can warp your views
pretty fast your newsfeed may have been

name:John Oliver

text:full of the times and the post stories
about Donald Trump's actual scandals but
many Americans logged onto Facebook
every day and saw like this and
this cesspool of nonsense would be a
problem anyway were it not for the fact

name:John Oliver

text:that one of the people in thrall to it
is our future president back in March he
claimed that a man who had rushed the
stage at one of his rallies had ties to
Isis something that had circulated
online and had been found to be untrue

name:John Oliver

text:and when that was pointed out to him
this was his response there's no ties to
Isis for this man no law-enforcement
official and this video that you link to
appears to be a hoax what do I know
about it all I know is what's on the

name:John Oliver

text:Internet
okay okay okay he's easily being on the
Internet is not a high bar for accuracy
if I edited Wikipedia to say that Dianne
Wiest sri lamb is Diane frosted
mini-wheats our next president would

name:John Oliver

text:believe that to be true in fact during
the campaign Trump routinely used his
platform to share wildly incorrect
information and even fellow
conservatives try to point out how
respond irresponsible this was you

name:John Oliver

text:tweeted out that White's killed by
blacks user statistics you picked up
from somewhere at a rate of 81% and
that's totally wrong
White's killed by blacks is 15% hey Bill
bill am I going to check every statistic

name:John Oliver

text:I get millions and millions of people
who died and a presidential continued
directions of people you know what fine
but this came out of radio shows and
everything else
okay okay okay okay okay I'm got it from

name:John Oliver

text:radio is maybe do weirdest nonsense
explanation I've ever heard it's like if
someone said this sandwich tastes weird
and you said but I found it in a hole if
there's something wrong with it then
what was it doing sitting in our hole

name:John Oliver

text:and that is the evil genius at working
weird conspiracy has always
been bubbling under the surface but
Trump was the first major candidate to
harness and fully legitimize it and it's
obvious in hindsight he came along and

name:John Oliver

text:told millions of people every crazy
email you've ever forwarded was true and
that at least in part is why he will be
our next president and to their credit
some Republican lawmakers were calling
him out on this during the campaign I'm

name:John Oliver

text:gonna tell you what I really think of
Donald Trump this man is a pathological
liar he doesn't know the difference
between truth and lies he was right he
was just right but before you think
Republicans might now stand up to Trump

name:John Oliver

text:I will remind you that by the end of the
campaign Ted Cruz like many others not
only said he vote for Trump but was
doing this hi this is Ted Cruz y'all I
was calling encourage you to come out
and vote like him

name:John Oliver

text:wow that is hard to watch this is Ted
Cruz just calling to remind you to vote
for a man who insulted my wife and said
my dad helped kill JFK any way at life
has no meaning thank you I want to die
take care now God is dead move on

name:John Oliver

text:goodbye now goodbye so there is very
little holding Trump back and remember
in January he will be sworn into office
and there is another wave of nausea for
you it hits you in small ways and large
doesn't it for instance had you

name:John Oliver

text:considered the fact that portraits of
Trump are going to be hanging in our
airports or that the man who disparaged
a gold star family will now be expected
to comfort the families of fallen
soldiers and maybe you tried to make

name:John Oliver

text:yourself feel better
fantasizing that he might Google how
much does the president get paid get
depressed and then resign but that is
when you remember Mike pence who
might be even worse because he looks

name:John Oliver

text:like he's from the 1950s but he thinks
like he's from the 1650s what's that you
say her pregnancy was terminated before
birth well clearly she's a witch hold a
funeral for the fetus and throw the
mother in a lake and I know this is all

name:John Oliver

text:depressing but it does bring us back to
the important question what the do
we do now
and for the record the answer is not
moved to Canada literally the only
excuse to ever migrated to Canada is if

name:John Oliver

text:you were born there originally it's
springtime and you are a goose that's it
that is it no instead here we're gonna
need to stay here and fight and not just
politically in four years when he's up
for reelection but constantly monitoring

name:John Oliver

text:legislation as it moves through Congress
and voting when your legislators
come up for re-election in two years but
that is still below the barest minimum
of what is going to be needed because
for the last eight years we've had a

name:John Oliver

text:president we could assume would
generally stand up for the rights of all
Americans but that is going to change
now so we're going to have to actively
stand up for one another and it can't be
just sounding off on the internet or

name:John Oliver

text:sharing think pieces or videos like this
one that echo around your bubble I'm
talking about actual sacrifice to
support people who are now under threat
so if you can afford the time or money
support organization

name:John Oliver

text:that are going to need help under a
trump administration for instance if
you're concerned about women's health
donate to Planned Parenthood or the
center for reproductive rights if you
don't believe man-made global warming is

name:John Oliver

text:a silly issue donate to the National
Resources Defense Council
if you don't think refugees are a
terrorist army in disguise donate to the
international refugee assistance project
oh and also given these guys track

name:John Oliver

text:record I would also recommend donations
to the n-double-a-cp Legal Defense Fund
The Trevor Project for LGBTQ youth and
the Mexican American Legal Defense and
Educational Fund would be perfect of
your compassion for Latinos those

name:John Oliver

text:Beyonce I don't know occasionally eating
a taco bowl and and you check
the box for recurring donations if you
can because this is not a short-term
problem and also just for a - I'll give
you just a dash of fun here I will point

name:John Oliver

text:out if you have relatives who supported
Trump you can give money in their name
so consider your holiday shopping this
year done Happy Holidays Nana The Trevor
Project thanks you
that I would single out for help here

name:John Oliver

text:and that is the press because as we've
seen Trump is a masterful denier of both
reality and responsibility he's a man
who would kick you in the nuts and then
tell you that your penis did it so the
press is going to face challenges not

name:John Oliver

text:just because Trump's chief strategist is
Steve banning of Breitbart news but also
because of yet another promise that
Trump made if I become president oh do
they have problems they're gonna have
such product I'm gonna open up our libel

name:John Oliver

text:laws so when they write purposely
negative and horrible and false articles
we can sue them and win lots of money
we're gonna open up those libel laws
okay well first there is no federal
libel law for Trump to open up and as

name:John Oliver

text:many supposed recipients of Trump's
charitable gifts might tell you you
can't open something up if it doesn't
exist but but that attitude of punishing
the press is genuinely worrisome now
that he is going to be President so

name:John Oliver

text:instead of sharing parties and means you
found on Republic goofs dot redneck and
Democrat peacock you need to support
actual journalism by buying a
subscription to outlets like The Times
or the post or your local newspaper or

name:John Oliver

text:donating to groups like Pro Publica a
nonprofit which does great investigative
journalism
what is if we don't get actively
involved to at least mitigate Trump's
damage things will not be okay

name:John Oliver

text:and yes the Sun will rise each day but
the continuing rotation of the earth
should not be your baseline expectation
of American society and I just need to
ask you one more thing it is going to be
too easy for things to start feeling

name:John Oliver

text:normal especially if you are someone who
is not directly impacted by his actions
so keep reminding yourself this is not
normal write it on a post-it note and
stick it on your refrigerator
hire a skywriter once a month tattoo it

name:John Oliver

text:on your arse because a clan backed
misogynist internet troll is going to be
delivering the next State of the Union
address and that is not normal it is
 up and the only thing that gives
me one degree of comfort is that I think

name:John Oliver

text:part of Trump might be realizing that
now to just look at his face
after meeting with Paul Ryan and getting
a glimpse of what this job actually
entails here is the genuine audio from
that moment

name:John Oliver

text:[Music]
[Applause]
I feel the same look I don't know what
happens from here and this is actually
our final show of the year
and normally on our last show we mash up

name:John Oliver

text:elements from the season and we dance
around in the studio but that doesn't
really seem appropriate tonight not just
because of the election but because 2016
has been an uncommonly shitty year from
the ongoing crisis in Syria to Zika to

name:John Oliver

text:Ryan Lochte being a douche to a
seemingly endless string of celebrity
deaths including just this week Leonard
Cohen so we have put something together
about how awful this year has been we
started it a little while ago but it now

name:John Oliver

text:feels more prescient than ever because
even though this year still has seven
weeks left I'm calling it early 2016 has
been the worst so thank you for
watching and please enjoy this tribute
to a truly terrible year let's face it

name:John Oliver

text:2016 has been one calamity after another
and while it will be remembered for the
giant calamity we all just witnessed we
shouldn't lose sight of the other
multiple ways this has been a shitty
year we could have loosed 2016 off the

name:John Oliver

text:calendar the perfect good with me pretty
rotten year I think most people would
would admit that it totally blew your
novel this world is feeling scarier it's
feeling a little colder for EU it was a
really crap year

name:John Oliver

text:the whole breaks it was kind of a mess
just a lot of like hatred to a lot of
groups I think I think that's like been
the staple of this year Syrian refugee
crisis
lots of sexism being very blatant I

name:John Oliver

text:think it's absolutely disgusting what
the city of flint did to to his
residents the New York Jets suck the
Yankees missed the playoffs I mean like
Kevin Durant going to UM go on a coma
state that was a move some

let's all try harder next year good
night
[Applause]
[Music]
we thought we'd check in on the latest

name:John Oliver

text:developments in the ongoing Trump
scandals that we've been calling stupid
Watergate a story with all the gravity
of Watergate if during it there was a
gas leak in the White House and Nixon
had been really into huffing glue well

name:John Oliver

text:well this week stupid Watergate had
another plot twist thanks to Rudy
Giuliani who only joined Trump's legal
team two weeks ago but on Wednesday made
big news during an appearance on Fox
basically Trump is on record denying

name:John Oliver

text:knowing about a $130,000 payment to
stormy Daniels to keep quiet about their
alleged affair but despite that for some
reason Giuliani Trump's lawyer now
remember offered a whole new story about
where the money came from that even

name:John Oliver

text:startled Sean Hannity I'm giving you a
fact now that you don't know it's not
campaign money no campaign finance
violation so they funneled it through
the law firm funnel throw of him and the
president repaid it oh I didn't know

name:John Oliver

text:that he did yeah there's no campaign
finance law zero zero
he not only contradicting what his
client said he topped it off with the
drunk sounding zero of a man saying my
girlfriend left me but guess how many

name:John Oliver

text: this guy gives zero now now in
saying that Giuliani may have just
exposed Trump to multiple new legal and
political problems but he wasn't done
because during his media blitz he also
undercut the White House's official line

name:John Oliver

text:on why James Comey was fired prematurely
announced the release of American
hostages from North Korea something that
as of this taping has still not happened
and made this creepy comment about what
would happen if prosecutors targeted

name:John Oliver

text:Trump's daughter I think I would get on
get on my charger and go right into the
writers their offices with a lance if
they go after Ivanka thought about her
son-in-law they've talked about him I
guess I Gerald is a fine man you know

name:John Oliver

text:that but men are you know disposable but
a fine woman like Ivanka come on
okay setting aside the sleaziness of
calling Ivanka a fine woman let's not
forget that he also just called a living
human being

name:John Oliver

text:disposable which is pretty harsh but
also it is Jared you know it's Jared he
is basically a six foot three inch stack
of packing peanuts it's Jared he's
useless now no Giuliani's interview was
so ill-advised and chaotic it left many

name:John Oliver

text:people on TV wondering what exactly had
become of him it's a long way from
America's mayor after 9/11 there's
something awful Giuliani yeah this is
not the time absolutely I mean this is
shocking coming from somebody who was

name:John Oliver

text:the post 9/11 mayor of New York City
after 9/11 I think Giuliani had a ton of
credibility with the American people
over this past week it seems like that's
kind of all worn off exactly people seem
to be as shocked at finding out who

name:John Oliver

text:Giuliani really is as a child at Disney
World who accidentally saw Mickey Mouse
pull off his head to reveal that he was
actually tilda swinton not only are you
not what I thought you are a moment ago
you are terrifying and if any

name:John Oliver

text:part of you is also wondering what on
earth happened to Rudy Giuliani tonight
we're going to try and answer that for
you because the short answer is nothing
he's always been this way and I know
that that might be a little jarring to

name:John Oliver

text:hear because the thing that he's most
famous for is being mayor of New York
City on 9/11 after which he was rightly
celebrated for being a calm steady
presence he was TIME's Person of the
Year he received an honorary knighthood

name:John Oliver

text:from Great Britain and its closest
American equivalent being played in a
made-for-tv movie by mr. James Woods
Democrats always talked about things
getting better Republicans did whatever
they could to make them better

name:John Oliver

text:that's what we're here for
[Music]
hot right right I mean come on who
wouldn't want to watch James Woods and
the lady from Kindergarten Cop trade
Republican themes pillow talk on a green

name:John Oliver

text:screen beach before exchanging the most
sexless kiss in the history of film how
did that not win all of the awards but
to truly understand Giuliani you have to
go back before 9/11 now he first made a
name for himself as a federal prosecutor

name:John Oliver

text:where he had quite a deep and lasting
taste for the limelight performing
stunts like going undercover to buy
crack while dressed in a Hells Angels
vest and a white dress shirt which made
him look less like a street junkie and

name:John Oliver

text:more like the third best member of an
all dad blues band called dad to the
bone now he eventually decided to run
for mayor which was somewhat risky at
the time due to some substantial baggage
an internal document produced by his own

name:John Oliver

text:campaign flagged a weirdness factor
around him because and this is true his
first marriage was to his second cousin
that's right America's mayor was a cosna
slur but-but-but don't worry don't worry
because he had an excuse for that

name:John Oliver

text:Giuliani says they only discovered their
family relation after many years of
marriage Oh didn't think it was
just a little bit weird at the wedding
ceremony when one side of the church was
both families and the other was just one

name:John Oliver

text:very nervous photographer who didn't
take a single picture now nevertheless
Giuliani was elected and and as mayor he
continued his love of the cameras
showing up everywhere from the Whoopi
Goldberg movie Eddy to an episode of Law

name:John Oliver

text:& Order to Bill Cosby CBS sitcom which
has not dated badly in any shape or form
but what many New Yorkers remember most
about the Giuliani is was his
unrelentingly abrasive personal style
he had a weekly local radio show where

name:John Oliver

text:he would take calls from constituents
which should be easy to do you just
listen to their concerns and you
politely disagree whenever necessary but
just listen to this exchange with a
ferret owner annoyed by the city's ban

name:John Oliver

text:on owning them as pets there's something
deranged about you you excessive
concern that you have for ferrets is
something you should examine with a
therapist this conversation is over
David thank you this excessive concern

name:John Oliver

text:with little weasels is the sickness
that's right
that is the mayor of New York actively
choosing to insult a New Yorker whose
only crime was being a fan of ferrets
and I am sure that when that ferret fan

name:John Oliver

text:was given the chance to present his side
without interruption
he was completely reasonable David
thanks for coming on thank you very much
you have in your hands my notes here say
one ferret is named master Linus Van

name:John Oliver

text:Pelt
and the other Princess Katie mini mitts
and that's it I hate to say it but
I think I'm on Giuliani side I'm on Team
Giuliani it turns out that ferret
advocates are a lot like ferrets I

name:John Oliver

text:thought I'd like them then I saw one and
now I'm not so sure but it went well
beyond picking fights with ferrets
enthusiasts because Giuliani adopted a
famously tough-on-crime stance with a
severely increased police presence and

name:John Oliver

text:an aggressive crackdown on so-called
quality of life crimes like panhandling
and jaywalking now this approach
antagonized a lot of people especially
people of color many remember it as a
time when the police were licensed to do

name:John Oliver

text:whatever they wanted a criticism even
shared by some former cops we will get a
lot of flack oh you're just doing this
because Giuliani is letting you do this
and in my heart I knew it was true if
police officers were just every single

name:John Oliver

text:person I want to stop you I'm gonna
question you I'm gonna frisk you then
the civil rights are gone and that is
pretty chilling because it's not like
it's easy to navigate New York streets
anyway at worst you're trying to get

name:John Oliver

text:around 14 Belgian tourists so don't know
how to walk in a city and at
best you might be ambushed by Billy
Eichner and if you are not up on your
Meryl Streep trivia you deserve
everything he's about to give you

name:John Oliver

text:now now by the end of Giuliani second
term many New Yorkers were sick of his
 at one point he even had to
move out of the mayor's residence and
made accusations of an extramarital
affair which he handled in the worst

name:John Oliver

text:possible way
Giuliani told the media in an
extraordinary news conference that he
intended to separate from the first lady
we've grown grown to live independent
and separate lives he'd given no

name:John Oliver

text:heads-up to his wife Wow Wow that is
just about the most humiliating way
possible to end a marriage other than
announcing publicly whoopsie i boned my
cousin but but then of course 9/11
happened and all was forgotten because

name:John Oliver

text:as America's mayor his reputation was
suddenly solid-gold
and upon leaving office he immediately
cashed in he wrote a book he gave
speeches making as much as $200,000 a
pop and he launched a consulting firm

name:John Oliver

text:called Giuliani Partners a name that
sounds a lot like a euphemism for
cousins who oh oh then there
Giuliani partners it was it was love at
first sight at that great grandmother's
funeral

name:John Oliver

text:naina always was a matchmaker now he
also became a partner in a law firm and
over the years his firm's represented
clients such as a tobacco company a
private prison company Bank of America
News Corp on Fox News and Purdue Pharma

name:John Oliver

text:the company that got in trouble for
supercharging the opioid crisis
basically the condom companies whose
logos you'd expect to see on an as car
driven by a homicidal grizzly bear and
then in 2007 Giuliani lost what was

name:John Oliver

text:supposed to be his destiny a campaign
for president which was catastrophic ly
bad he talked non-stop about 9/11 with
some supporters even holding 8 $9 and 11
cents per person fundraiser all of which
triggered this memorable line from been

name:John Oliver

text:candidate Joe Biden during a debate Rudy
Giuliani there's three there's only
three things he mentioned in a sentence
and now in a verb in 911 I mean there's
nothing else
now he's right Giuliani could not stop

name:John Oliver

text:leveraging 911 for his own ends as
evidenced by his classic children's book
one fish two fish red fish 911 now in
the end his campaign flamed out
spectacularly he did not win a single
state and he went from the front-runner

name:John Oliver

text:for the presidency to being out of the
race by January having spent around
fifty million dollars or to end up with
precisely zero delegates or as he would
put it zero
exactly exactly busy

name:John Oliver

text:and after that completely humiliating
presidential flop Giuliani ended up
fading from view
eventually washing up in d-list places
like this
[Music]

name:John Oliver

text:ENC mark we posted by rudy guiliani
holy that is a steep fall just ten
years after being named time Person of
the Year Giuliani was doing VJ work for
a cable networks editing for television
presentation of Scarface just think

name:John Oliver

text:about how crazy that is
that would be like if in ten years from
now Bravo announced a fuckboys of the
90s marathon hosted by Malala yousafzai
how the did that happen what did I
miss

name:John Oliver

text:clearly a significant amount of goodwill
has somehow been squandered Wow Wow
after that after that Giuliani fretted
away years as I rent a quote pundit on
cable news saying various awful things
and he didn't truly join Trump's orbit

name:John Oliver

text:until January 2017 when he was named
Trump's cybersecurity advisor
now why did Trump give him that job who
knows and maybe it was because Giuliani
had a security consulting business
called Giuliani security and safety

name:John Oliver

text:despite seemingly having no real
background in cybersecurity and if he
watched Giuliani for even 10 seconds you
do really get the sense that he tries to
check his email by opening a word doc
and typing hi Google check email thanks

name:John Oliver

text:Rudy although the truth is Trump's real
affection for Giuliani probably came
from his willingness during the campaign
to lend his last shreds of credibility
to various amounts of poisonous nonsense
like this if I did one tenth of what

name:John Oliver

text:Hillary Clinton did I'd be in jail she
paid people to create violence at his
rallies she sold 20% of our uranium to
Russia I have eight times online since
January in which she's had massive
coughing fits so go online and put down

name:John Oliver

text:Hillary Clinton illness take a look at
the videos for yourself now obviously
that is all horseshit but I do agree
with him on one point there you should
definitely go online and visit Hillary
Clinton illness calm and take a look at

name:John Oliver

text:the videos because they are i opening
and the reason I know that is we bought
the URL for
automatically redirect to something that
Rudy Rudy Guiliani would hate this
animation of to fair it's

name:John Oliver

text:awesome also it is worth noting stop it
also it is worth noting that Giuliani
security and despite Giuliani's
cybersecurity expertise didn't seem to
think to buy the URL Giuliani - security
calm so we now own that as well the only

name:John Oliver

text:thing that irritates more than two
ferrets two ferrets or cousins
not I mean the sexual tension
there is unbearable you know each other
so well and when you look at all of this
in total you realize that Giuliani's

name:John Oliver

text:role as Trump's lawyer isn't an
aberration everything in his life has
led to this point and while he may well
be providing terrible legal
representation for Trump he's actually
the most honest representation of him in

name:John Oliver

text:general because think about it they're
basically two versions of the same
person they're both New Yorkers coasting
on their reputations they both had three
marriages neither of them can shut up
when in front of a camera and perhaps

name:John Oliver

text:most importantly they both want to
Ivanka which which is weird for Trump
because Ivanka is in his family and is
weird for Giuliani because she isn't so
what happens what happened to Giuliani
is really not the right question he's

name:John Oliver

text:always been like this what's going to
happen to him is more to the point
because he is now the public face of
Trump's legal team and who knows what
he's gonna come up that maybe he Prem's
Trump down through sheer incompetence

name:John Oliver

text:maybe he gets fired in the next two
weeks although to be honest at the rate
we're going he is so fatally flawed as a
human being that he's probably going to
end up president although although to do
that he'll need a campaign website which

name:John Oliver

text:he might find difficult because for the
record Rudy Giuliani 2020 for calm is no
longer available because we bought it
and it links to a dancing ferret giving
you the thing
you

name:John Oliver

text:you
standardized tests the fastest way to
terrify any child with five letters
outside of just whispering the word it's
currently testing season all over the
country and with that comes the usual

name:John Oliver

text:flood of anxiety and school produced
videos designed to get kids in the mood
what does the test say job number two
pencils out your number two pencils out
get your number two pencils out what the
tests say you - number two pencils out

name:John Oliver

text:get your number two pencils out the
standardized tests look like amazing fun
I wish I could take one right now bring
me a pencil
I'm number two please but it gets better
because one Elementary School in Texas

featuring a monkey mascot look let's all
agree there is no scenario in which the

just imagine what now all it was your

put you under there's about a 20% chance

words for you
pointings those those videos and monkey
mascots would have you think that

name:John Oliver

text:testing is amazing which is why this
spate of recent news stories has been so
surprising in the lower Hudson Valley
many districts reported that more than
25% of their students opted out more
than 1,700 elementary middle and high

name:John Oliver

text:school students opted out of taking the
PARCC test those five kids houses they
took the test
yeah like almost the entire auditorium
was filled with kids that didn't take it
not a single junior showed up to take

name:John Oliver

this week Wow the entire class boycotted
the test the only other thing an entire
class of juniors has ever managed to
agree on is that The Scarlet Letter
could be told much simpler with emojis

text:we got it read lady finger finger devil
baby we've all read the book is a good
story that American students are sick of
tests between benchmarks diagnostic
spree and mock tests they take a lot of
them students are taking between 10 and

name:John Oliver

text:20 standardized tests depending on the
grade a total average of 113 different
ones by graduation 113 is a lot of tests
it's approaching the amount that you'd
ask your doctor for the morning after
you woke up from a one-night stand with

name:John Oliver

text:Colin Farrell just just give me all of
them twice and this amount of testing
can take a toll teachers have reported
kids throwing up kids crying especially
the younger ones and it's the pressure
that's true in fact this happens so much

name:John Oliver

text:that official instructions for test
administrators specify what to do if a
student vomits on his or her test
booklet and something is wrong with our
system when we just assume a certain
number of kids will vomit tests are

name:John Oliver

text:supposed to be assessment of skills not
a rap battle on 8 Mile Road
Oh mmm why did your mom make you
spaghetti
she knew tonight was rapid battle nights
so how did we get here what the

name:John Oliver

text:explosion of testing can be traced back
to the 90s when you probably remember
stories like these about the state of
public education
when 40 Nations recently took the
International math and science test

name:John Oliver

text:American students scored near the bottom
and that must have hurt especially
because you knew the French children
weren't even trying go on play with your
silly numbers they tell you nothing of
the true nature of the solar a week

name:John Oliver

text:before you in response to statistics
like that
President George W Bush on just his
third day in office announced his No
Child Left Behind program it passed
Congress with bipartisan support because

name:John Oliver

text:of course it did voting against No Child
Left Behind is like voting against no
puppy left unsnag 'old what what monster
would do that
his name is patches and he needs love
the program was designed to be

name:John Oliver

text:data-driven and involved testing
children every single year in order to
identify and fix failing schools in the
counter billi system must have a
consequence otherwise it's not much of
an accountability system it's hard to

name:John Oliver

text:argue with any of that
unfortunately accountability is one of
those concepts that everybody's in favor
of but nobody knows how to make work
like synergy or maxi dresses no matter
who wears them they look like a poncho

name:John Oliver

text:to waterfall you look like the ghost of
Gwyneth Paltrow future I only haunt
Branch goo
No Child Left Behind increase the number
of federally mandated tests from 6 to 17
and the fixation on testing was

name:John Oliver

text:something which our current president
seemed to be against as he ran for
office don't tell us that the only way
to teach a child is to spend too much of
a year preparing him to fill out a few
bubbles in a standardized test we know

name:John Oliver

text:that's not true
Wow that man knew how to pander to
teachers and yet you know what else they
should be pool tables and the teachers
lounge and every year you should be able
to slap one parents vote for me I'm out

name:John Oliver

text:of here
what's this breakthrough took office he
didn't get rid of tests instead he added
his own education initiatives like race
to the top which encourage states to
adopt the common core which featured a

name:John Oliver

text:logo of snails sixty-nining and again
the intentions here were good because we
do have underperforming schools and
there are major economic and racial
disparities in the quality of education
children receive and anything that can

name:John Oliver

text:help us narrow those gaps is obviously a
good thing the problem has been the
implementation for instance many states
now tie teacher pay to performance using
one particular approach
it's called value-added analysis rating

name:John Oliver

text:teachers based on student test scores
for instance if a student who ranked in
the 60th percentile test higher at the
end of the year
the teacher gets a better rating if the
student Falls the teachers rating Falls

name:John Oliver

text:okay well that explains why many
teachers class and decorations that used
to read believe in yourself now say
don't come me on this
and what well the idea of trying teacher
pay to student improvement sounds great

name:John Oliver

text:in theory here's how it can work in
practice I have four students who's
predicted scores were literally
impossible one of my sixth-grade
students had a predicted score of 286
point three four however the highest a

name:John Oliver

text:sixth grade student can earn is 283 the
student did earn a 283 incidentally
despite the fact she earned a perfect
score
she counted negatively towards my
evaluation because she was three points

name:John Oliver

text:below her predicted score that is
ridiculous the only way she could have
hit her predicted score was if she
answered everything right roped a few
extra questions of her own got those
right and then stapled them to the test

text:that teacher lives in Florida which uses
this formula to assess teachers a
formula which looks like the kind of
thing that aliens carve into an
anti-semites cornfield and many of these
formulas on which teachers careers

name:John Oliver

text:depend were partly inspired by research
and this is true that modeled the
reproductive trends of livestock
basically we judge the nuance of what
happens in the complicated world of a
child's mind the same way that we judge

name:John Oliver

text:this look I don't know what we did wrong
but your child is going to either pass
algebra or birth a healthy calf I don't
know flip a coin with the stakes this
high the tests had better be good but
there is ample reason to suspect that

name:John Oliver

text:that is not the case just look at the
Florida Comprehensive Assessment test or
FCAT a Florida school board member was
concerned and a little suspicious when
he learned that only 39% of his state's
tenth graders had performed at or above

name:John Oliver

text:grade level in reading so we had an idea
I asked the district at that point to
give me the closest thing they could
legally to the FCAT reading and math
test and I took it that test labeled me
as a poor reader and I have a couple of

name:John Oliver

text:master's degrees and I've been reelected
four times and I teach 39 graduate
courses at six universities in this
country okay okay okay
we get it the test sucks anything else

scores on the up cap and it feels like
it's much of the stomach this is unfair
and I don't want to lose my opportunity
to take my classes or get because what

everything I said about wanting to take
a standardized test in fact you know
what
bring out the monkey with you what is
wrong with you you made that little girl

name:John Oliver

text:cry think about what you've done no no
don't you don't you don't sit off you
can't think about what you've done
Oh shame on you
this one you have to ask yourself if
standardized tests are bad for teachers

name:John Oliver

text:and bad for kids who exactly are they
good for well it turns out they're
operated by companies like all these and
let's just focus on the largest one
Pearson as of 2012 they had nearly 40%
of the testing market almost triple

name:John Oliver

text:their nearest competitor and if you've
never heard of them then congratulations
but just mention their name to any
parent or teacher in a state they
operate in and you see what happens
because Pearson are the educational

name:John Oliver

text:equivalent of Time Warner Cable either
you've never had an interaction with
them and don't care or they have ruined
your life
Pearson have a shocking amount of
influence over America's schools so much

name:John Oliver

text:so that at this point a hypothetical
girl could take Pearson tests from
kindergarten through at least eighth
grade but a test by the way that she
studied for using Pierce and curriculum
and textbooks taught to her by teachers

name:John Oliver

text:who were certified by their own Pearson
test if at some point she was tested for
a learning disability like ADHD that's
also a Pearson test and if she
eventually got sick of Pearson and
dropped out well she'd have to take the

name:John Oliver

text:GED which is now guess what also a
Pearson test in fact the only test they
have no hand in is the HPV test you
might take in college I can only assume
that they'll get on that as soon as they
see this show Pearson has

name:John Oliver

text:enjoyed spectacular growth and profits
and yet their track record is littered
with complaints concerning technical
glitches slow grading and even the
contents of their tests take take what
happened in New York just a few years

name:John Oliver

text:ago almost 30 different test questions
have now been declared invalid because
they're confusing or have outright
errors they'd already pulled six
questions from an English exam related
to a bizarre passage about a talking

name:John Oliver

text:pineapple talking pineapple well at the
risk of sounding like a DreamWorks
executive talking to a CGI animator tell
me more about this talking pineapple
students had to answer questions about
the story which they say goes like this

name:John Oliver

text:a pineapple challenges a hair to erase
other animals figure the fruit has a
trick up its sleeve but the hair wins
and the animals eat the pineapple it
ends with the moral pineapples don't
have sleeves I was really confused

name:John Oliver

text:because I expected a lot more from them
that article about the pineapple in the
hair was stupid and absurd yeah she's
not wrong about that because we looked
up that test section and we couldn't
work out all the answers that pineapple

name:John Oliver

text:item doesn't remotely work as a test
question it barely works as a doors
lyric but it's it's not just Pearson's
questions that are a problem it's how
they check the answers the company
posted this ad to Craigslist it's to

name:John Oliver

text:find people to grade the exams
Craigslist they look for scorers on
Craigslist
Pearson chooses tests graders the same
way that you'd look for a mattress full
of bedbugs or a no-strings-attached hand

name:John Oliver

text:job and to be clear here just to be
clear this is not just a Pearson problem
across the whole testing industry you
can find former graders who will tell
you horror stories we looked at an essay
every two minutes a short answer every

name:John Oliver

text:five seconds every ten seconds we don't
understand your kids we don't understand
anyone's kids that is not an acceptable
answer from a person who may be
responsible for the future of your child
it's barely acceptable from the

text:are given out not based on merit but on
quota I was told when I was beginning a
project that last year you know there
were a certain amount of to a certain
amount of three is a certain amount of
force we expect that to be similar this

name:John Oliver

text:year if that's not similar they will
tell you we're scoring too many threes
we're scoring too many fours they'll say
you have to learn to see more papers as
a three you have to learn to see more
papers as a four that makes no sense if

name:John Oliver

text:the content of what you're looking at
has not changed that's not telling a
baseball umpire hey we've got a problem
with
averages you need to see more home runs
and strikeouts and more strikeouts as

name:John Oliver

text:doubles do it now
and I would love to show you more
questions from these tests but
unfortunately that's not only difficult
it's often illegal because both states
and companies have fought to keep test

name:John Oliver

text:questions secret for having teachers and
students signed statements like I will
not use or discuss the content of secure
test materials and while they'll say
that this is to protect against cheating
it does seem odd that even if you see

name:John Oliver

text:something wrong on a test you can't tell
anyone
standardized tests basically enforce the
rule that all subway riders
instinctively obey if you see something
keep it the to yourself we've all

name:John Oliver

text:seen someone vomit in a purse before
leave it
focus ahead and leave it bury it look
look we've had more than a decade of
standardized testing now and maybe it's
time to put the test to the test

name:John Oliver

text:the original goal was to narrow the
achievement gap and boost our scores
relative to the rest of the world
well a 2013 study found no support for
the idea that no child left behind an
hour at the achievement gap and our

name:John Oliver

text:scores on the international tests have
not only failed to rise they're slightly
down and I do not want to hear what that
French kid thinks of those results cause
this time and all this money and your
highs to the top has been how you say a

text:meandering jog on a treadmill
for a middle of what both presidents
asked for when selling their reforms
higher standards are the right goal
accountability is the right goal an
accountability system must have a

name:John Oliver

text:consequence otherwise it's not much of
an accountability system right so let's
look at that because as far as I can see
this is a system which has enriched
multiple companies and that pays and
fires teachers with a cattle birthing

name:John Oliver

text:formula confuses children with talking
pineapples and as the same kind of rules
regarding transparency that Brad Pitt
had for Fight Club so so for Pearson the
other companies and all the lawmakers
who have supported this system the true

name:John Oliver

text:test is going to be either convincing
everyone it works or accepting it
doesn't work and fixing it because at
the risk of sounding like a standardized
test score your numbers are not good and
if it seems unfair to have your fate

name:John Oliver

text:riding on a complicated metric that
fails to take institutional factors into
account and might not even tell the
whole story well you're not wrong about
that but you do not get to complain
about it and if all this pressure to

text:increase your numbers is making you feel
nauseous like you might vomit at any
second
and don't worry I've got four words for
you that'll make you feel better
here comes

name:John Oliver

text:our main story tonight concerns the past
week's terrible events in Missouri an
officer shot an 18 year-old man outside
an apartment complex in Ferguson
Missouri it is unclear at this hour what
led to the shooting but witnesses say

name:John Oliver

text:the teenager was unarmed angry
confrontations between protesters and
police in riot gear the same anger and
outrage that exploded into a chaotic
night of looting and violence this whole
story is depressingly familiar and there

name:John Oliver

text:are so many unanswered questions
regarding why an officer would shoot an
unarmed teenager what is absolutely
clear is that the police have handled
everything since then terribly and the
tone-deafness

name:John Oliver

text:began with this asked how many times
Brown was shot st. Louis County Police
Chief Jon Belmar said it was more than
just a couple but I don't think it was
many more than that just just think
about what he's saying there not much

name:John Oliver

text:more than more than twice don't you try
and minimize this anymore
look listen everyone only very many more
than one bullet was fired so everybody
calm down shall we
the police then refused four days to

name:John Oliver

text:release the name of the officer involved
and when they eventually did they
packaged it with a DVD extra that no one
wanted at the same time they released
video of Michael Brown allegedly
carrying out a store robbery minutes

name:John Oliver

text:before he was shot and killed and that
has sparked new outrage yeah of course
it has because it's irrelevant
if the police wanted to distract
everyone with a video that has
absolutely nothing to do with Michael

name:John Oliver

text:Brown shooting they should have just
released Ghostbusters instead it's
exactly as relevant to everything that
happened afterwards but but the more the
week went on the more you got the sense
that those in charge in Ferguson don't

name:John Oliver

text:have the best sense of how their
community feels just listen to the mayor
we've never seen this kind of violence
we've never seen this kind of
frustration or tension between the races
I've always been proud to say that to

name:John Oliver

text:people
I know we've always gotten along and I
know our communities still gets along
well Oh we're absolutely famous for it
presumably that is why I the mayor of
Ferguson I'm currently on national

name:John Oliver

text: television presumably we're
talking about how well our town is
getting along right now and always has
the thing is if you ask around in
Ferguson you get a slightly different
story the Carson resume is frequently

name:John Oliver

text:it's all through the day is all to the
night then they not beating us
physically they doing it verbally here's
the thing the mayor doesn't understand
that as a general rule not one should
ever be allowed to say there is no

name:John Oliver

text:history of racial tension here because
that sentence has never been true
anywhere on earth there is tension
between emperor penguins and gentle
penguins cute Gentoo penguins flapping
over here stealing our fish not you

name:John Oliver

text:chinstrap penguins you're cool you
you've got you got as a good at math so
so which one of these two men is right
about what life as a young
african-american in Ferguson is like
well too much of that let's look at the

name:John Oliver

text:police force what does it look like in a
town which is about two-thirds
african-american what does the makeup of
your police force the number and how
many of them are white I just want
clarification of that I mean they keep

name:John Oliver

text:saying three of our three are
african-american but that actually
believe it's five there was six but one
left fairly recently we also have a
Hispanic and two Asian Pacific Islanders
exactly it doesn't stop bad guys we got

name:John Oliver

text:a couple of white guys who occasionally
listen to hip-hop music I mean
Macklemore sure but still
also also we have six Norwegian
Americans who really enjoyed the Lion
King on Broadway so it's like it's more

name:John Oliver

text:diverse than it seems but despite the
presence of both of the Pacific
Islanders and of course the Hispanic
let's not forget him the Ferguson Police
do seem to target minorities 86% of
police stops are african-americans 92%

name:John Oliver

text:of police searches nearly 93% of arrests
even though they stopped more blacks
more White's had contraband yeah of
course more White's had contraband they
knew that if you look like this you
don't get stopped if you are white in

name:John Oliver

text:Ferguson you would need to be snorting
cocaine directly off your dashboards to
get stopped by the police whereas if
you're an african-american in Ferguson
like say Henry Davis here you may have a
slightly different experience because

name:John Oliver

text:while in custody in the Ferguson Jail in
2009 officers grabbed him and pushed him
and struck him multiple times they say
they were provoked although oddly there
is no video of this incident despite the
fact that jail is equipped with video

name:John Oliver

text:cameras and what is known though at this
point is that he was later charged with
four counts of destruction of city
property for bleeding on their uniforms
and I've got to say he was lucky that he
wasn't eating spaghetti at the time of

name:John Oliver

text:his beating well they would have
upgraded that charge to a felony and
that is just a local police the County
police also have had their share of
problems a st. Louis County police
lieutenant is without a job tonight he

name:John Oliver

text:was fired for allegedly ordering patrol
officers to arrest black people shopping
in South County oh it wasn't just that
he ordered racial profiling it was how
he allegedly did it with his colleagues
claiming that he said things like let's

name:John Oliver

text:have a black day and let's make the jail
cells more colorful now let's be fair
let's be fair here let's have a black
day is an awesome thing to say if you
are shaft
and let's make the jail cells more

name:John Oliver

text:colorful is entirely appropriate if
you're an interior designer with a
folder full of paint swatches however if
you're a white police officer it's not
ideal to say either of those which is
not to say that all cops are bad they

name:John Oliver

text:are clearly not also the people of
Ferguson wants and need an effective
police force but perhaps their
relationship was best summed up by this
photo from earlier this week
not just ludicrously aggressive police

name:John Oliver

text:facing off against an unarmed man but
also the fact that someone has clearly
written to the police on the postbox
something something apparently CNN did
not notice when they were using this
photo during all of their coverage now

name:John Oliver

text:you might also notice in that photo that
the police are troublingly dressed like
they're about to launch an assault on
Fallujah well it turns out that that is
no coincidence since 1996 in response to
the war on drugs a Department of Defense

military equipment to local and state
police after 9/11 the Department of
Homeland Security made additional
equipment available to local law
enforcement through federal funds for

this has happened on such a scale that
it enabled small towns like Keene New
Hampshire to apply for a Bearcat a
military-grade armored personnel truck
which they needed because as their

is far-reaching and often unforeseen and
cited as a possible target their annual

seem in there dude you can't even see
them looks cool dude they go look up big

here's the thing no it hasn't got that
bad because unless you live in downtown

months ago recommended against using em

they're actually unsafe they tear up the
streets they have a high rollover
potential exactly the only vehicle that
should be tearing up the streets of
Saginaw is Chad souped up Honda Civic

soldiers some why in this photo from
Ferguson are they wearing camo
they are northwest of st. Louis not
northwest of the Amazon if they want to
blend in with their surroundings they

where their guns are pointed if you were
actually in the military you would know
that you are not supposed to do that on
the military were trained on something
called escalation of force which

name:John Oliver

text:basically means the only time that
you're really going to point a weapon
directly at someone is when you're ready
to pull the trigger and instead of that
we've seen in Ferguson that police are
just wandering around with their weapons

name:John Oliver

text:up at all times pointing them at people
that obviously didn't pose a threat well
what they don't currently pose a threat
but you know it's really all about what
they might do now they could for

and then wander around pointing it at
people that would be terrifying
the points at the pointer is 0.8 if you
are a cop in the United States you
should dress for the job you have not

name:John Oliver

text:the job you want because if you have all
this equipment it's going to go to your
head look at Doraville Georgia
population 8,500 the police there got a
tank a while back and up until a few
days ago this video was on the front

[Applause]
the name of that song is and this is
true die die and it was a
good choice because believe me that
video does not pair well with Simon &

name:John Oliver

text:Garfunkel now that video was just a
training exercise but the problem is
police departments don't just use this
stuff for training thanks in part to
this kind of access to military hardware
there has been a massive rise in both

name:John Oliver

text:the number and the use of Police
Department's SWAT teams the number of
SWAT raids have gone up by fourteen
hundred percent since the 1980s an
estimated 50,000 now take place every
year

name:John Oliver

text:just keep that clip in mind when I tell
you that 79 percent of SWAT deployments
are now for executing search warrants
and most of those were for drug
investigations so yes if you are getting
high in your dorm room right now you are

name:John Oliver

text:not paranoid there is a SWAT team
outside and they are coming to get you
all of which all of which brings us back
to this week and to Ferguson so how do
you improve things there well you could
demilitarize the police force to stop

name:John Oliver

text:things looking like this but that would
just change the optics the substance of
the problem would still be there as was
embodied by a police officer on the
streets of Ferguson this week who was
dressed entirely normally the phrase

name:John Oliver

text:bring it you animals is barely
acceptable during a zoo escape it's not
even acceptable in the restaurant in
Mary Poppins where penguins are waiters
brilliant you've in animal like don't
treat them like that that they'll piss

name:John Oliver

text:on your suit that they'll pissing
yourself and you'll deserve it that kind
of statement betrays an inability to see
the citizens of Ferguson as individuals
and instead treats them as a threatening
whole and that is a top-down problem

name:John Oliver

text:because last night this is how the
governor of Missouri decided to try and
rebuild trust between the police and the
community
I signed in order to clearing a state of
emergency an Ori implementation of a

name:John Oliver

text:curfew and he apparent in the impact and
a curfew in the impacted area furthest
in a perfect so you took a community
tired of being treated as criminals and
imprisoned them all in their own houses
for a night and in doing so employed the

name:John Oliver

text:tone of a pissed-off vice-principal
trying to restore order at an assembly
if we're going to achieve justice
we must first have and maintain peace
this is a test the eyes of the euro are
watching that is profoundly patronizing

name:John Oliver

text:look let's see if you can all remain
quiet for 20 minutes and then we'll see
if you can all go and play outside if
even the governor can't distinguish
between the good and the bad elements of
the community and decided to punish

name:John Oliver

text:everyone equally then that should go
both ways I know the police love their
ridiculous unnecessary military
equipment so here's another patronizing
test let's take it all away from them
and if they can make it through a whole

name:John Oliver

text:month without killing a single unarmed
black man then and only then can they
get their toys back
[Applause]
diplomacy the thing that keeps us from
immediately going to war with our

name:John Oliver

text:enemies and from telling Lichtenstein
how we really feel
you are a snobby polyp on Switzerland
and they should have you removed
immediately it is a busy time for
diplomacy in the Trump White House what

name:John Oliver

text:we've done planning the North Korea
summit weighing what to do about Syria
and a state visit with Makran next week
none of which is helped by the fact that
no one has seen Jared in months where is
Jared how can we make crucial foreign

name:John Oliver

text:policy decisions without the White
House's goodest boy and on top of all
that there's actually a massive decision
that Trump has to make just around the
corner the Iran deal is coming up
after months of will he won't he read

name:John Oliver

text:her it the nuclear deal is on the
president's mind once again this week as
he faces a May 12th deadline to decide
whether to recertify it there's a
growing consensus that this time around
it may finally be dead once and for all

name:John Oliver

text:well that is not a good sign for the
Iran deal because whenever there is a
will he won't he question regarding
Trump you can pretty much guarantee that
he will pick the worst possible option
will he pull the u.s. out of the Paris

name:John Oliver

text:Accord he did will he try and ban
Muslims from entering the country he did
when he looked directly into the Sun
during the solar eclipse while pointing
at it as if to say look the Sun he did
of course he did of course he did that

name:John Oliver

text:and Trump has made it very clear how he
feels about the Iran deal he's called it
terrible a catastrophe stupid insane
incompetent really sad horrible
horrendous horrible horrible terrible
incompetent and one of the dumbest and

name:John Oliver

text:most dangerous misjudgments ever which
is coincidentally also exactly what
Trump writes in Don Junior's birthday
card every year is appropriate and and
those criticisms are just the tip of a
very large iceberg I think it's maybe

name:John Oliver

text:the worst deal I've ever seen I think
it's the worst deal I've ever seen
negotiated my number one priority is to
dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran
this is the worst deal we got nothing we
got nothing they have so out negotiated

name:John Oliver

text:our people because our people have
babies they have no idea what they're
doing they will find out that if I win
we're not babies there's no more being
babies anymore oh that's right Iran
there's no more

pull-ups and going tinkle in our Oshkosh
we can put our own store in our Juice

big boys and we have shoes with laces
and also a bike that has spider-man on

name:John Oliver

text:it that our uncle Jim got us for
Christmas because we are big boys and
there's no more being babies anymore no
more look make make no mistake this deal
dying could have huge lasting
consequences which makes it a little odd

name:John Oliver

text:that nobody is really paying much
attention to the fact that on May 12th
if Trump doesn't feel like this deal has
been fixed to his liking he may refuse
to waive a key sanction which could
threaten the entire thing so tonight

name:John Oliver

text:let's look at the Iran deal what it is
why Trump hates it so much and what's
likely to happen if he kills him to
start it probably would help to know
just a little of the history between the
u.s. and Iran which has been fraught to

name:John Oliver

text:put it mildly
here is a ludicrously brief recap in
1953 the CIA helped orchestrate a coup
to depose Iran's democratically elected
prime minister replacing him with the
Shah who was friendly to the US and to

name:John Oliver

text:whom funny story we supplied weapons and
a nuclear reactor the Shah was
overthrown in a revolution in 1979 and
dozens of American diplomats were held
hostage eventually the Ayatollah
Khomeini took power converting the

name:John Oliver

text:country to an Islamic theocracy that is
in an insulting ly brief history of the
last 60 years alone and there is a lot
that I've left out there but if you do
want to learn more just subscribe to my
new podcast talking Tehran with John

name:John Oliver

text:Oliver and james van der beek is just a
small taste of it let's pick up where we
left off with the privatization of
state-owned enterprises in Iran you're
talking about the work of Rafsanjani no
no I'm not talking about that John you

I'll tell you we got the backing of

now okay okay
John do you send a lot of mass emails

text:it's a pretty good podcast it's pretty
good and and look if you didn't know
that james Van Der Beek was an expert in
Iranian history expand your expectations
of what people are capable
but the point is in many Americans Minds

name:John Oliver

text:Iran's image is now reduced to a place
where US flags are set on fire and
whether a chance of death to America and
the truth is that is still part of
Iranian political culture much of the
power in the country is held by

name:John Oliver

text:conservative clerics who forced
religious compliance at home and pursue
an aggressive foreign policy abroad they
are widely believed to be supporting the
Houthi rebels in Yemen and Bashar
al-assad in Syria and are a major funder

text:of the terrorist group Hezbollah and the
current Ayatollah is still saying stuff
like this and sure I love the tall fury
by God's favor and grace nothing called
the Zionist regime will exist in the
region by twenty five years from now

name:John Oliver

text:okay so it's not the most important part
there but the country's name is Israel
not the Zionist regime if you're gonna
make appalling threats against a nation
at least get their name right I'm sure
that you would not like it if I called

name:John Oliver

text:Iran holds papac Harmony's palace of
Persians would you know you wouldn't
like it you wouldn't like it at all but
the truth is that is only part of the
picture of Iran there's also a large
educated relatively liberal middle class

name:John Oliver

text:among whom opinions of America tend to
be considerably more positive you can
see it in the fact that they have
knockoffs of American restaurants
they're called mash Donald's ZFC and
pizza hats which are obviously direct

name:John Oliver

text:ripoffs of marsh Donald's zfg and pizza
how and Iran's current president Hassan
rouhani is relatively moderate by
Iranian standards even going so far as
to tweet a few years back I wish all
Jews especially Iranian Jews a blessed

name:John Oliver

begins a statement with the words I wish
all Jews and actually sticks the landing
you kind of have to hand it to him there
and pro-western views are particularly
pronounced among young people born after

name:John Oliver

text:the Revolution in fact a few years back
Thrasher Magazine my favorite skateboard
magazine did a story on Iranian
skateboarding culture which has thrived
despite one considerable obstacle Iran
as under sanctions right now and it's

name:John Oliver

text:really hard for them to impor
thing from the West this kind of put the
skaters in a position where they were
actually forced to figure out a way to
make their own words we saw one kids
getting a board made of solid steel

name:John Oliver

text:which is kind of crazy it's an Iranian
skateboard it's made of metal sick deck
bra although if it was me I'd double up
on the grip tape on my top sheet so we
don't slam gonna go sketchy on the nose
grind I do hope you enjoyed that joke

name:John Oliver

text:because it took one of my writers 50
 minutes on the skateboarding
Wikipedia page to research it but that's
true but don't those sanctions actually
want one of the reasons that the Iran
deal happened in the first place because

name:John Oliver

text:after the international community
discovered that Iran was secretly
building up a nuclear program it was
understandably concerned and imposed
crippling sanctions affecting every part
of Iran's economy from oil to plane

name:John Oliver

text:parts to banking and investment one key
motivator in Iran coming to the table to
negotiate was relaxing some of those
sanctions and they got that all the
partners in this deal the US Britain
France Germany the EU Russia and China

name:John Oliver

text:agreed to lift specific sanctions on
Iran so that's what Iran got out of this
deal I guess the question is what did we
get and the answer to that is quite a
lot it requires Iran not to enrich
uranium to weapons-grade for 15 years to

name:John Oliver

text:reduce its number of operating nuclear
centrifuges from 19,000 to just over
5,000 and to increase the time it would
take to make a bomb from a few months to
a year it's true and those would be
concessions from Iran the deal required

name:John Oliver

text:them to reduce their stockpile of
uranium by 98% and mandated that they
would not enrich uranium above three
point six seven percent which is
significantly lower than the 90% needed
for weapons and try to make a bomb at

name:John Oliver

text:under four percent enrichment is like
trying to get drunk off a single can of
PBR you can't it cannot be done there's
no way to do it not unless
you're a gerbil and even then only if
you're drinking on an empty stomach

name:John Oliver

text:and look that that's not all the deal
also had strict conditions for
monitoring and verification to make sure
that they were in compliance and if they
weren't we could snap those sanctions
back it was a pretty good deal and yet

name:John Oliver

text:many felt it was too generous to Iran
Benjamin Netanyahu called it a bad
mistake of historic proportions and here
in the u.s. there was a hard opposition
with ads like this
[Music]

name:John Oliver

text:[Music]
[Music]
Wow
that is a hostile way to make your point
there is only one ad that you could
completely justify being interrupted by

name:John Oliver

text:a nuclear explosion and it is this one
[Music]
[Applause]
good I'm glad those children are dead
but but for all the talk over here about
Iran getting everything they wanted you

name:John Oliver

text:should know that Iranian hardliners were
furious arguing that they had given up
way too much Iran's lead negotiator was
this guy javad zarif and some chilling
cell phone footage emerged of him being
confronted by a member of the iranian

name:John Oliver

text:parliament and just listened to what was
said to him if Isis comes to our country
you will be the first to take the blow
that is both scary and honestly not
really consistent with how Isis operates
they generally don't come to a country

name:John Oliver

text:and say okay nobody dies until we find
that first guy nobody kills anyone until
that first guy takes the first blow we
do this in order or we don't do it at
all where Isis
let's not come off like crazy people but

name:John Oliver

text:but despite all that opposition on both
sides the deal was signed which was a
huge achievement or as Donald Trump
would put it a complete disaster I've
studied this issue in great detail I
would say actually greater by far than

name:John Oliver

text:anybody else believe me
Oh believe me and it's a bad deal
okay so let's be absolutely clear here
Donald Trump has never studied anything
in great detail if you asked him what
color his wife's eyes are he would say

name:John Oliver

text:34d but firm so so what specifically
does Trump think is wrong with this deal
well he has a number of complaints and
the first has to do with monitoring
their nuclear facilities in terms of you
know surveillance they have the right to

name:John Oliver

text:self inspect how about that or their
major the most dangerous they can self
inspect okay so that's just not true
they cannot self inspect the deal allows
for regular monitoring of all declared
nuclear sites one of which even has

name:John Oliver

text:24-hour video surveillance and it's done
by the International Atomic Energy
Agency the UN's nuclear watchdog which
has already confirmed ten successive
times that Iran is complying with the
deal and fun fact if Iran complies just

name:John Oliver

text:once more they win a free meal at Pizza
hat so that's just an extra little fun
incentive for them to stay in line and
that is not the only thing that Trump
gets wrong about the deals inspection
process how about this

name:John Oliver

text:we see something wrong or we think
there's something wrong so we have to
wait 24 days before we go in but before
the 24 days start there's a whole
procedure so who knows how long it could
be could be six months okay so what he's

name:John Oliver

text:talking about there is the fact that
while again inspectors have constant
access to their declared sites they also
get access to any other site military or
civilian where they suspect undeclared
nuclear activity now Iran can push back

name:John Oliver

text:on those suspicions but once the IAEA
demands access Iran has just 24 days max
to let them in and it is a pretty tall
order to completely clean up every trace
of an isotope with a half-life of 710
million years in just 24 days think

name:John Oliver

text:about it that's not even long enough to
adequately clean your apartment after
you rent it out on air B&B how is there
Jesus inside my piano
what monster would do this this isn't an
accident

name:John Oliver

text:it must be why they wanted a piano but
but but one of trumps other complaints
is that some parts of this deal expire
in 10 or 15 years and as he sees it that
leads to an obvious problem the bigger
problem is that they can keep the terms

name:John Oliver

text:and still get the bomb by simply running
out the clock again that is simply not
true they can't keep the terms and get
the bomb the terms expressly forbid them
from doing that what Iran could do in
theory is wait for parts of the deal to

name:John Oliver

text:expire in 10 years then it could ramp up
its nuclear program
getting it closer to a bomb but here's
the thing if the deal blows up Iran
could start doing that right now in zero
years and zero is less than 10 trust us

name:John Oliver

text:we ran the numbers on this ourselves I
spent a week at kangra speaking with the
location chair of mathematics Michael
Cates and and I feel virtually certain
zero is less than 10 also you should
know before the deal Iran had enough

name:John Oliver

text:enriched uranium to eventually create
eight to ten bombs which remember they
gave up meaning they currently have
enough for zero bombs which again is
less than ten I cannot stress enough the
extent to which 0 is less than 10 it

name:John Oliver

text:just is we have to agree on that or
we're all and look it is
important to remember this deal isn't
just between the u.s. and Iran there are
multiple countries involved none of whom
are anxious to change its terms even

name:John Oliver

text:Britain's Boris Johnson a man who looks
like what would happen if Draco Malfoy
got an MBA and developed a drinking
problem even he thinks a renegotiation
is a non-starter I don't think anybody
has come up with a better idea near

name:John Oliver

text:think it's on incumbent on those who
will pose the jcpoa really too to come
up with that better solution exactly you
can't just be against something without
having any plan for what comes next
Trump is like a cat on an airplane

name:John Oliver

text:trying to escape from its carrier okay
but if you get out then what do you have
a cat sized parachute in there with you
what's your plan here
obviously I'm not gonna say capsized
parachute without showing you a cat in a

name:John Oliver

text:parachute that is just a given I
wouldn't do that to you
and look what Wall Trump has articulated
broadly what he wants some of his
demands are complete non starters he
wants a ban on ballistic missile testing

name:John Oliver

text:unconstrained access to any military
sites and no expiration of any clause in
the agreement ever and if those are
deal-breakers for him this deal is
broken and what you would hope that
someone would talk him round Trump has

name:John Oliver

text:surrounded himself with Iran Hawks his
nominee for Secretary of State is Mike
Pompeo who's reportedly said of Iran we
know they're cheating we're just not
seeing it which is a hell of a statement
from a guy who gives rim jobs to

name:John Oliver

text:guerillas and short-short sure no one
has ever seen Mike Pompeo giving a real
job to a gorilla but that's how we know
he does it think about it and even more
worrisome is john bolton his new
national security adviser bolton is a

name:John Oliver

text:far-right conservative who Donald Trump
had originally considered for the job in
2016 but reportedly hesitated because of
his walrus style mustache and I've got
to say I agree with Trump on that one
that moustache is a huge problem he

name:John Oliver

text:looks like he's possessed by the ghost
of Borat the point is the point here is
Bolton has long been a critic of the
Iran deal I think the deal is inherently
flawed I think it's a strategic debacle
for the United States

name:John Oliver

text:you can always tinker around the edges
and the question is whether putting
lipstick on a pig is really going to
make a difference here come on
this deal is preventing Iran from
getting nuclear weapons it's not a pig

name:John Oliver

text:with lipstick besides pigs don't need
lipstick to look beautiful you
superficial asshole these are beautiful
just the way they are I think you need
to conform your completely unrealistic

both of us gone much further than that
remember that ad with the exploding

you're wondering well what's his
alternative to an Iran deal it can't be

this speech that he gave to a group of
Iranian dissidents in Paris last year
the declared policy of the United States
of America should be the overthrow of
the mullahs regime in Tehran

name:John Oliver

text:[Music]
[Applause]
the behavior and the objectives of the
regime are not going to change and
therefore the only solution is to change
the regime itself and that's and that's

name:John Oliver

text:why before 2019 we here will celebrate
in Tehran thank you very much
holy to my ears that is the
National Security Advisor calling for
the invasion of Iran before the end of
the year which is so flagrantly horrific

like the Barefoot Contessa announcing
that she's going to murder and cook her

point she's been so obvious if no one
actively stops her it's partly on us so

name:John Oliver

text:look unless Congress or our European
allies figure out something they can
sell to trump as a fix
it seems that Trump is going to reimpose
sanctions on May 12th and if he does
that this deal could collapse and the

name:John Oliver

text:damage of that would be long-term and
potentially irreversible just set aside
the fact that you would alienate a whole
generation of younger Iranians who
support this deal just think about what
this would do to America's credibility

name:John Oliver

text:why would North Korea consider signing a
nuclear agreement with us if we just
broke the agreement we signed only three
years ago with Iran and if this deal
dies and Iran receives its nuclear
weapons program it could then start a

name:John Oliver

text:nuclear arms race in the Middle East and
the problem here is I can't offer you
much hope there is not really a write
your Congressman solution to this we
could be in serious trouble
because two of trumps top advisors are

name:John Oliver

text:like him dead set against this deal and
they're getting backup from Sean Hannity
who showed the president watches so much
advisors refer to him as the shadow
chief of staff Hannity hates this deal
too so there is not really a way for us

name:John Oliver

text:to get a moderating voice into this
conversation short of buying time on
Hannity show this week and running an ad
like this
but how are you hey there Donald
sorry for rock your supper I'm a cowboy

name:John Oliver

text:don't like pain when I cap and I'm here
to tell you the Iran deal may not be
perfect but it helps restrict Iran's
ability to start making a bomb for at
least 10 years you blow up the deal and
that turns into zero years and if I've

name:John Oliver

text:learned one thing from all these years
of cowboying and cathing it's that zero
is way less than 10 that's correct also
you really want to listen to a guy with
a mustache like this
don't do it Donald don't do it

name:John Oliver

text:hey does anyone smell gas oh my god the
stove
that ad is scheduled to run during
Hannity in the DC area on fox news this

you
the adopted home world of Bjork what are
you now the reason we have to talk about

text:Earth tonight is this president Trump
revealing his decision to the country to
the world we're out
he says pulling out of the Paris climate
Accord I was elected to represent the
citizens of Pittsburgh not Paris okay

name:John Oliver

text:first relax no one for a second thought
that you represented Paris hardly
because everyone knows Paris is
represented by a smoking french bulldog
who found the first course to be
derivative and jiazhen

name:John Oliver

text:but it is true this week Trump announced
he would pull out of the Paris climate
agreement which is hardly surprising as
a title it is so off-brand for him it
might as well have been called the
globalist cuck surrender or a light jog

name:John Oliver

text:yet yet pulling out of this is a huge
deal and to understand why it helps to
keep in mind one key number and it's two
degrees Celsius now it's a bit of a
shorthand but the concern is that if we
fail to limit temperature rise to that

name:John Oliver

text:number things get very bad and
potentially irreversible scientists say
will likely see longer droughts and more
intense heat waves which can cause big
disruptions to the world's food supply
if we don't start with rapid emissions

name:John Oliver

text:reductions and substantial emissions
reductions that will pass a danger point
beyond which the consequences for many
people and countries on earth will
simply become unacceptable and
eventually disastrous it's true and we

name:John Oliver

apocalypse like the one in the movie
2012 we're talking about an actual
global disaster like the movie 2012
and the serious danger may actually be
more imminent than you think one

text:estimate says that to have a good chance
of avoiding the two-degree threshold
human emissions of co2 should stay below
this level in total this is our
so-called carbon budget and by the end
of last year we were estimated to

emission trends continue we would go
above that critical line in about 20
years and that is not a long time 20
years ago South Park was on TV Foo
Fighters were touring and Paul Rudd

name:John Oliver

text:looked like this what I'm saying is 20
years ago was basically now so the Paris
agreement central aim was to try and
keep our global temperature rise below
that 2 degree threshold and to do that
each signatory would set their own goals

name:John Oliver

text:with a plan to reconvene every five
years to ideally set more ambitious
targets and look it was not perfect
some critics at the time felt that it
did not go far enough that the key
achievement was for the very first time

including China and India to commit to
taking action it was a historic moment
and it was celebrated like this through
the moments the world agreed to tackle
climate change Jacques Lecoq of e

agreement was born and emotions spilled
over so much so that Lawrence Tobias

ok ok
I'll say this if you are trying to
convince people of the gravity of a

it would not be appropriate for a judge

did Trump announced that he would pull
out this week well one clue may have
come during his speech on Thursday when
he actually talked about that happy
celebration that you just saw but seem

name:John Oliver

text:to see something sinister in it the rest
of the world applauded when we signed
the Paris agreement they weren't wild
they were so happy for the simple reason
that it put our country the United

thing I don't quite know yet is why but
we don't have time to get into it the
point is if the agreement was a scheme
to hurt American businesses you know who

name:John Oliver

text:that might be news to many American
businesses because they were not just in
favor of this Agreement they even made a
last-ditch attempt to change Trump's
mind 25 companies including Microsoft
and Intel have purchased a full-page ad

name:John Oliver

text:in today's New York Times arguing the
agreement generates jobs and economic
growth
well come on he was clearly never going
to be convinced by an ad in The New York
Times how was he going to see it if

name:John Oliver

text:those companies willing
wanted to get into intention they needed
to talk KFC into putting out a full
bucket ad which he would read on the
toilet while eating chicken because that
at its core is who our president is but

name:John Oliver

text:but it turns out it turned out that
rather than listening to those companies
the president was getting advice from
climate change skeptics like if EPA
chief scott pruett and human custody
hearing c banner although really

name:John Oliver

text:transactions were in keeping with a
long-held schedules of being as
concerning climate change he has called
it expensive and a hoax created
by china and he repeatedly brought that
idea up on the campaign trail often

name:John Oliver

text:before losing track of what he was
talking about and performing real-time
word-association
china is it abiding by anything they're
buying all of our coal we can't use coal
anymore essentially they're buying our

name:John Oliver

text:con they're using it now when you talk
about the planet it's so big out there
we're here they're there it's like
they're our next-door neighbor right in
terms of the universe Miss Universe by
the way I've made a great deal when I

name:John Oliver

text:sold oh did I get rid I was a great year
huh you know they broke my choppers on
that they said he talks about illegal
immigration we're not gonna put him on
televisions being sued like crazy you
wouldn't believe and NBC I made a great

name:John Oliver

text:deal with them just like an amazing deal
why can't you finish your thought why
can't you finish I thought that was 36
seconds touching on at least seven
different topics including the non
phrase broke my choppers and yet he did

name:John Oliver

text:not conclude a single thought there
ain't goldfish with me about squeazy go
hey focus get back to China we were
talking about China what is wrong with
this gold turn I'm drowning
and look when you combine Trump's lack

name:John Oliver

text:of attention to detail with his
deep-rooted paranoia you get the wildly
misleading reasons that he cited on
Thursday for pulling out of Paris for
instance he seemed to think the
agreement committed America to shutting

name:John Oliver

text:down coal-fired power plants China will
be allowed to build hundreds of
additional coal plants so we can't build
the plant but they can according to this
agreement India will be allowed to
double its coal production by 2020 think

name:John Oliver

text:of it India can double their coal
production we're supposed to get rid of
errors okay for the record the agreement
doesn't actually ban America from
building coal cars it doesn't even
contain the word coal each each country

name:John Oliver

text:sets its own goals that they can meet
however it wants so that is what that's
just wrong as if the fact that Trump
said in this speech America would
continue to be the cleanest and most
environmentally friendly country on

name:John Oliver

text:Earth which is objectively untrue
because over history the US has emitted
by far more carbon than any other
country and we still emits more per
person than almost any other nation so
that's like Mark Wahlberg saying he's

name:John Oliver

text:going to continue to be the best dentist
on the planet how how are you going to
do that that's not what you are Mark
maybe you could decide to do that one
day but you're definitely not doing it
now then there is Tom's concern over the

name:John Oliver

text:Green Climate Fund which finances
projects in developing nations helping
them adapt to the impact of climate
change and reduce their emissions what
now as Trump describes that fund the
Green Fund would likely obligate the

name:John Oliver

text:United States to commit potentially tens
of billions of dollars of which the
United States has already handed over 1
billion dollars nobody else is even
close ok ok now to his credit that is
actually an impressive amount of

name:John Oliver

text:misleading in very few words in
fact here is everything that he just
said let's break those words down first
the green fund
is not called the green fund it's called
the Green Climate Fund I know but still

name:John Oliver

text:friends would likely obligate the United
States to commit money there is no
enforcement mechanism in the Paris
agreement the US could just easily
refuse to pay the bill something Donald
Trump has a lifetime of practicing

name:John Oliver

text:absolute potentially pain of billions of
dollars
no we committed three billion dollars
you can't just inflate three to
potentially tens I can't say that you
have had potentially tens of failed

name:John Oliver

text:marriages
I can only say you've had three because
you have you have had three failed
marriages and yes I'm very much
including your current one and finally
finally nobody else is even close to

name:John Oliver

text:paying more that is just willfully
misleading well we have given the most
so far in sheer dollars we are one of
the richest countries and one of the top
emitters and when you rank contributions
as a fraction of GDP we are

name:John Oliver

text:thirty-second so Trump's description of
the agreement is so flamboyantly
deceptive it would have been equally
accurate thing to say compliance with
the Paris agreement would likely require
all Ducks to wear jean shorts and it

name:John Oliver

text:would potentially cost each and every
American citizen five fish and a dump
truck full of hamsters that would be as
true as what he just said and even even
when he tried to strike a reassuring
tone he got it wrong

name:John Oliver

text:so we're getting out but we will start
to negotiate and we will see if we can
make a deal that's fair and if we can
that's great and if we can't that's fine
except no it is not fine is it because
the leaders of Germany France and Italy

name:John Oliver

text:said in a statement we firmly believe
that the Paris agreement cannot be
renegotiated and I would not test
Europe's leaders when it comes to
pulling out of a major international
agreement Britain is trying that

name:John Oliver

text: right now with brexit and maybe
you can send your demands to the same
email address that you are upset up for
that
it's lick dot our nuts go
yourselves start a you soap

name:John Oliver

text:from align drop them align tell answer
but but I have saved France most
ludicrous misunderstanding of the
agreement for last because for a man who
cites the agreement strict onerous and
draconian terms what he does not seem to

name:John Oliver

text:comprehend is each nation sets its own
goals remember and more importantly the
whole thing is voluntary the
agreement as a whole is not legally
binding and doesn't penalize nations who
fail to meet their commitments but it

name:John Oliver

text:does include a process designed to shame
them into compliance it's true the only
penalty was shame and unfortunately this
president is completely immune to the
very concept of that if they even tries
to shame him into compliance he could

name:John Oliver

text:just hold up this photo of him in a too
short bathrobe and what appears to be a
child's bed and say I posed for that you
cannot hurt me any more than I've
already hurt myself and at this point
you may be thinking well hold on if it's

name:John Oliver

text:all voluntary then what is the harm in
leaving well the truth is its
substantial and let's start with just
the harm to America's standing in the
world alone because Trump's decision to
leave this Agreement has pissed off

name:John Oliver

text:almost everyone this morning German
Chancellor Angela Merkel called it
extremely regrettable Canadian Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau called it
disheartening and the Vatican went
further saying mr. Trump's decision was

name:John Oliver

text:a disaster for everyone Wow think about
that we are getting talks by the
Vatican and not by the Nazi Punk the
cool one that's worse that is like
getting into a Twitter fight with the
Dalai Lama he he doesn't snap up him but

name:John Oliver

text:when he snaps his cap card and not that
reputational harm can have real costs
for businesses abroad one environmental
negotiator who worked in the George W
Bush administration described this
decision as the worst thing for brand

name:John Oliver

text:America since Abu Ghraib and that is
rough because a bad Association can
stick with a brand for a long time just
ask sexual assault pudding cups double
murder car rentals or mr. touchies fresh
and tasty pedo sandwiches

name:John Oliver

text:and then then there is a harm to
American workers the very people Trump
is claiming to protect because most of
the world now realizes that in order to
reduce emissions we need to shift to
renewable forms of energy and the more a

name:John Oliver

text:government encourages that the faster it
happens the quicker costs come down and
the more likely that that country is to
be at the forefront of a whole new
industry creating countless jobs in the
process and you know who knows that

name:John Oliver

text:China or some would say China Trump just
handed a huge advantage to them they've
not only cancelled plans to build more
than 100 coal-fired power plants they're
also dramatically increasing investment
elsewhere china plans to spend more than

name:John Oliver

text:three hundred sixty billion dollars on
renewable energy by 2020 which it says
will create at least 13 million new jobs
so you know what in a way Trump is
fulfilling his campaign promise he is
creating millions of new jobs he's just

name:John Oliver

text:doing it for the wrong country
and if you want proof that the jobs of
today and tomorrow are in renewable
energy Francis knew prescient in manual
macron actually issued a call this week
to America's workforce to all scientists

name:John Oliver

citizens were were disappointed by the
decision of the President of the United

you got to go you got to go
click Rococo get the out of here
you little get out get out
the real concern the real concern the
real real concern here is that America's

name:John Oliver

text:absence from the Paris agreement could
make other countries less inclined to
meet their commitments and remember that
could quickly become catastrophic and
that brings us to our final point given
that we cannot afford just to wait for

name:John Oliver

text:years to vote Trump out of office what
can be done now
well for starters companies need to
continue to step up and to their credit
some like Walmart and Bank of America
have set deadlines to power themselves

name:John Oliver

text:completely with renewable energy and
nearly half of the fortune 500 companies
including Philip Morris International
have pledged to reduce their carbon
footprint in the coming years that is
right this is a story where Walmart Bank

name:John Oliver

text:of America and Philip Morris end up
being the good guys which just feels
inherently surprising it's like I just
said great news everyone
Ebola Isis and that dentist who shot
Cecil the lion are gonna save the planet

name:John Oliver

text:for us thanks I give the bet you are the
deck and look look it is not just
company stepping up in the wake of
Trump's decision multiple governors have
announced their intention to hold
themselves to the Paris agreement goals

name:John Oliver

text:as have many met including notably the
mayor of Pittsburgh you know the city
that Trump cited as the reason he was
pulling out of the agreement then there
Bill Peduto was pretty clear about what
he thinks about Trump's decision

name:John Oliver

text:Pittsburgh is the poster child of
showing why the Paris agreement is good
economics for the United States in what
we did today sets us back decades
Wow that is pleasantly surprising on so
many levels not the least of which is I

name:John Oliver

text:had always just assumed that Pittsburgh
there was a Heinz ketchup drank Lombardi
trophies so we're all learning a lot of
things tonight but what this means is
that the onus is now on politicians at
the state and local level to do what

name:John Oliver

text:Donald Trump cannot be bothered to and
unfortunately that means that you now
need to find out where your mayor your
governor and even your state reps stand
on climate change and first you'll have
to find out who they are but then then

name:John Oliver

text:you will need to find out their
positions and look
you'll get lucky maybe yours is great or
maybe you live in Pennsylvania and
you're represented by state senator
Scott Wagner who has an interesting

name:John Oliver

text:theory for what might be causing global
warming the earth moves closer to the
Sun every year we have more people you
know humans have warm body so is keep
coming off we're just going through a
lot of change but I think we are as a

name:John Oliver

text:society doing the best we can I don't
even know where to begin Ben I mean yes
the earth does move closer to the Sun
every year but then it moves further
away from the Sun because that is what a
 year is our body heat is not

name:John Oliver

text:warming the planet and we are clearly
not doing the best we can because we
keep putting idiots like Scott Wagner in
positions of power and he is not alone
in North Carolina they're considering a
bill that would freeze progress that

name:John Oliver

text:that state has made towards renewable
energy and one of the people who would
have a vote on that is state Rep Larry
Pittman so what is Larry's nuance take
on climate our planet runs on a cycle it
goes up and it goes down and the Lord

name:John Oliver

text:designed it that way the main thing that
causes global warming is the Earth's
relationship to a big ball of gas that's
burning at there that we call the Sun
and it is the height of hubris for human
beings to think that we can have any

name:John Oliver

text:effect on them no Larry no the hunters
hubris is not opposing climate change
against God's will the height of hubris
is according to Wikipedia six-foot-two
and he just pulled us out of the Paris
agreement so colossal that resemble

name:John Oliver

text:those guys in anyway you are going you
can a need to work to get them out of
office as soon as you can and all of
this is going to take work attention and
energy and I know that's not easy but
Trump may have inadvertently done us a

name:John Oliver

text:tiny favor this week because the problem
with climate change is that it's always
felt so abstract impersonal and far off
into the future and the usual symbols
that we use don't don't do much to fix
or help that it's either a graph that's

name:John Oliver

text:difficult to understand or a sad polar
bear on a small piece of ice and it's
hard to get emotionally fired up over
that I don't leave
know that there he he could be a dick
but but finally finally this week the

name:John Oliver

text:climate change movement may have gotten
a symbol to rally around because
apparently it was never quite enough for
us to motivate ourselves out of love for
this large gassy orb but maybe just
maybe we can now motivate ourselves to

name:John Oliver

text:do something out of our loathing of this
one
tonight is judges whereas of America's
only formal muumuus judges occupy an
exalted position in American life but as
important as they are we tend not to

name:John Oliver

text:think about them very much unless one of
them makes news as happened earlier this
month a federal court last month lifted
Alabama's ban on same-sex marriage but
Roy Moore the state Supreme Court Chief
Justice ordered state judges to ignore

name:John Oliver

text:the federal ruling yes
Alabama judge Roy Moore refused an order
to let gay people marry living up to his
state slogan
Alabama boldly refusing to accept
diversity and the inevitable since 1819

name:John Oliver

text:now - just out of interest what was his
judicial reasoning for such a decision
I think the gay marriage is an
alteration of the definition of marriage
in the United States Supreme Court does
not have the authority or the federal

name:John Oliver

text:courts do not have the authority to
interpret a word that disputes the
Constitution hold on hold on not only
can the Supreme Court override a state
that's basically its job that's not
telling dill it can't ruin any foodstuff

name:John Oliver

text:it comes into contact with
that's what dill does get out of
everyone's food till you are filthy weed
your wreckingball know him up you might
be thinking how did that man get to
become the highest judicial officer in

name:John Oliver

text:the state well like eighty-five percent
of state judges in America he was
elected 39 states hold elections for
judges and America is virtually alone in
doing this in fact there's only one
other country on Earth that does it on

name:John Oliver

text:this scale you can guess which you're
wrong it's Bolivia hey a country you
think about so little you haven't even
realized that's not Bolivia this
Bolivia actually actually that's still
not Bolivia this is Bolivia or is it or

name:John Oliver

text:if it this this game is never not going
to be fun no
America has been elected judges since
the early 1800s
and the thing is it all began from a
good impulse judicial elections

name:John Oliver

text:originated as a reform measure so people
were concerned that you know judges were
being selected behind closed doors there
wasn't any kind of public accountability
okay and public accountability sounds
great the problem is for many judges

name:John Oliver

text:nowadays there's almost none of that
most run unopposed last year in LA
County 150 out of 151 incumbent judges
ran on a post and come on they can at
least go through the motions of
pretending there was another candidate

name:John Oliver

text:just throw a robe on a Pelican and tape
a gavel to his wing or I'll tell you
what you're in LA just pretend you're
considering Blake Lively for the job
movie studios do that all the time and
the problem is whenever a judge does

name:John Oliver

text:face a challenger they have to run like
a politician and that's why many states
are subjected to the bizarre spectacle
of ads like these hi I'm Allan Lauri I'm
running for our Supreme Court it's law
free is in law and free this is my house

smells good

and sometimes campaigns opt to sell a
judge with sheer catchiness there's a
judge they call Paul Newby he's got
criminals on the run

scared Neal take him down one by one
Paul Newby he's a tough old judge
respected everywhere Paul knew be just
as tough but fair Paul knew be criminals
best beware what just happened am I

for him to catch them Duke boys and look
I know what you're thinking could any
commercial be less relevant to a judge's
qualifications for the job I give you

when I'm choosing a judge the only thing
I really care about is who can hold
their breath the longest here's the
thing all three of the men in those ads

name:John Oliver

text:won their elections their judge is now
judging people and the stupid ads are
actually the least problematic what's
far more worrisome is when judges run
ads like these without blinking an eye

the problem with an elected judiciary is

name:John Oliver

text:sometimes the right decision is neither
easy nor popular and yet campaigns force
judges to look over their shoulder on
every ruling because while political
attack ads can be aggressive judicial
attack ads can be downright horrifying I

like the memory of that away now now
what those evil shadows are saying
sounds awful but here's the problem none
of those three men were actually set
free by Judge killbride but in each case

name:John Oliver

text:he merely questioned the legality of
procedural points in their trials which
is a judge's job but there's no room in
campaigns for nuance that's why you
don't see bumper stickers reading
justice is complicated requiring the

text:sublimation of our baser instincts which
though difficult is the only thing that
separates us from the Annika piece
Kilbride 2015 the danger rates though
the danger is if ads like those get
inside judge's heads and make the rule

name:John Oliver

text:more harshly to protect themselves in
the future and the problem is that does
happen there are some academic studies
that have suggested that judges do
change their behavior so for example in
election years if you look at judges

name:John Oliver

text:sentencings decisions
judges tender tend to be harder on crime
that's terrifying
because you shouldn't be sitting in a

elections are inherently compromising
because campaigns cost money
and that money has to come from
somewhere which leads to the horrifying

name:John Oliver

text:spectacle of judges hitting up lawyers
for donations for attorneys like Jules
oldsman this is the most expensive time
of the year election season is when
lawyers like him have to dig deepest

name:John Oliver

text:hour or so he'll get a call from a
judges campaign looking for a
contribution it's very hard to say no
it's impossible to say no judge is
asking lawyers to give them campaign
money is the definition of a conflict of

think about it giving money to two

you'll be glad to hear that that judge

wasn't for taking those contributions
but rather because he allegedly once
showed cell phone pictures of his

that yielded their disciplinary hearing

he had intentionally groomed his penis
for photography now that's not really

had to know that you deserve to know
that and look it gets a guess well step
one one step was judge is also
frequently benefits from campaign money

name:John Oliver

text:given by businesses and special
interests and while they may claim that
that doesn't affect them multiple
studies have suggested otherwise we
looked at the Ohio Supreme Court and
asked the question of how often they

name:John Oliver

text:vote for contributors who appear before
them and the answer was overall about 70
percent of the time and in the case of
one justice Harris O'Donnell 91 percent
of the time now justice O'Donnell says
that there was no connection there but

name:John Oliver

text:the point is he still said sure why not
in response to people who gave him money
91 percent of the time and the only
other person who does that is Nicolas
Cage that's the only it's been a
disaster Nicolas it's been a romp

and to be fair many judges don't like
this system even Ohio Supreme Court
justice Paul Pfeiffer has said I never

does explain Pfeiffer's campaign slogan
justice for all no kissing on the mouth
though I have to say something for the

since citizens united PACs

fact remember the banjo ad the one
you're still humming in your head that
was sponsored by a PAC called the North

convicted of stabbing my victims with a

called just PAC whose donors include

Commerce and John Deere PAC yes the
people who make tractors also apparently
helped make judicial decisions for the
people of Illinois and look when you
have a system where judges are serenaded

compare themselves to prostitutes and
live in constant fear of tractors you
have a problem because faith in a strong
independent judiciary is essential for a

text:make a fuss about now run along
scallywag I said good day to you good
day sir now the reason for our segment
three years ago was that the future of
net neutrality was in question and to
their credit the FCC took steps to

name:John Oliver

text:safeguard ease and if you're wondering
why I'm even bringing up a problem that
was seemingly solved this is why the
Trump administration today announcing
plans to rollback Obama era net
neutrality rules unequal access of

name:John Oliver

text:course it seems that the Trump era will
basically controls the everything that
happened on Obama's watch I genuinely
would not be surprised if one night
Trump went on TV just to tell us that he
personally killed every turkey Obama

name:John Oliver

text:ever pardons
but the point is though once again net
neutrality is in trouble and if you need
a refresher on what it involves
please let me start of the 2007 viral
smash video Chocolate Rain explain it to

name:John Oliver

text:you in 30 seconds net neutrality is the
idea that your pipe to the internet
whether that is your cable internet
connection your LTE wireless internet
connection however you are receiving
information via the internet that

name:John Oliver

text:pipeline to the Internet is not allowed
to arbitrarily pick favorites in terms
of the content that you consume for
example if you like to use Google search
and your roommate likes to use being
searched your internet service provider

name:John Oliver

text:can't say well being is paying us a lot
of money so we're going to slow down
Google and Yahoo and their other search
engine competitors to make being load
fast he's right
although that's obviously just a

name:John Oliver

text:hypothetical there's clearly no such
search engine as Bing or maybe there is
I don't know that there's really only
one way to find out and that's by
googling it and that kind of the point
but but net neutrality is about more

name:John Oliver

text:than just theme and it's hot it is the
principle that Internet service
providers or ISPs like these guys should
not be able to engage in any sort of
fuckery that limits or manipulates the
choices you make online it also helps

name:John Oliver

text:ensure a level playing field so that big
companies cannot undermine small
companies before they can take off and
without it ancestry.com could easily
crush my new site just tell me if I'm
related to a Nazi com

name:John Oliver

text:it's like ancestry.com except you get to
skip all the net neutrality is
objectively boring and that used to work
to ISPs advantage but more people know
what it is now which is why some
companies have started putting out

name:John Oliver

text:statements trumpeting their support for
a free and open Internet that Verizon
even created a video to calm any
concerns that you might have hey what's
up everybody Jeremy here with Craig
silliman who is our general counsel and

name:John Oliver

text:leads our public policy group let's jump
right into it is the FCC going to kill
what we know as the open Internet rules
or net neutrality the FCC is not talking
about killing the net neutrality rules
in fact not we nor any other ISP or

name:John Oliver

text:asking them to kill the open Internet
rules all they're doing is looking to
put the open Internet rules in an
enforceable way on a different legal
footing now that sounds reasonable and
why wouldn't you trust the commitment to

name:John Oliver

text:open access of a man sitting at a table
literally blocking an entire hallway but
but well but while a different legal
footing sounds pretty benign it is not
and it is also worth understanding how
net neutrality landed on its current

name:John Oliver

text:legal footing because it happens to
directly involve the Rison so let me
explain and unfortunately to do that I
have to introduce you to two terms even
more boring than net neutrality
specifically title 1 and title 2 of the

name:John Oliver

text:Communications Act of 1934 the
equivalent of chasing an ambien with a
shot of chloroform but here is very
broadly what happened back in 2010 the
FCC wrote net neutrality rules governing
ISPs which at the time were regulated

name:John Oliver

text:under the less strict title one and the
companies found those net neutrality
rules inconvenient in fact the Rison
successfully sumed the FCC arguing that
it didn't have enough authority to
enforce those rules and the court ruled

name:John Oliver

text:that if the FCC did want strong
enforceable net neutrality their best
option would be to reclassify ISPs under
title 2 which allows for much stronger
oversight so the FCC did that and the
fact they did was huge

name:John Oliver

text:so when Verizon claims hey we love the
open Internet but why don't we just put
it on a different legal footing it's
basically a Jay Simpson asking why you
won't let him hold any of your samurai
swords come on juice you know why you of

name:John Oliver

text:anyone should know why
and the ISPs now have a powerful ally on
their side because Trump has appointed a
new head of the FCC and it is this guy a
jape I is known for being anti
regulation Pro merger last month he said

name:John Oliver

text:he wanted to quote take a weed whacker
to current FCC rules and predicted net
neutrality quote days are numbered Wow
okay days are numbered and take a weed
whacker or serial killer talk so that is
pretty ominous when the Code of Federal

name:John Oliver

text:Regulations looks out of its window at
night there's just a j't pie standing
silently holding his weed whacker
waiting for his chance but the dangerous
thing about pies that he presents
himself as a fun down-to-earth nerd the

name:John Oliver

text:kind of guy whose Twitter feed is full
of quotes from The Big Lebowski he
quotes it all the time and look grunting
the Big Lebowski is fine in certain
contexts for example if you're an actor
and it's 1998 and you're filming the

name:John Oliver

text:movie The Big Lebowski but it is
completely intolerable in any other
context and that's that's not his only
fun guy at the office traits just watch
his very first press conference as
chairman I would be happy to take care

name:John Oliver

text:questions from the panel mining telecom
daily how do you plan to examine
yes ad July is the kind of guy who has a
fun oversized novelty mug and he is
really proud of it his theory is showing
it off to a reporter here he is showing

name:John Oliver

text:it off to his Twitter feed and in his
first speech to his staff as
commissioner he said I love walking into
my office poring about a gallon of
coffee into my infamous Reese's Peanut
Butter Cup spark and starting my day and

name:John Oliver

text:you heard right he described his own mug
as infamous which is offensive for two
reasons first and no point should you be
describing your own fun mug allowed in
the company of other adults and second
it's a mug pouring of mug

name:John Oliver

text:infamous is like calling your neti pot a
real panty dropper
no context can that be remotely true but
for all the pies doofy hey I'm just like
you guys persona there is there are some
things about him that you should really

name:John Oliver

text:know he's a former lawyer for Verizon
and despite being a smart man he sure
loves to play dumb over why is PS were
ever moved to title 2 for decades before
2015 we had a free and open Internet
indeed the free and open Internet

name:John Oliver

text:developed and flourished under
light-touch regulation we weren't living
in some digital dystopia before the
partisan imposition of a massive plan
hatched in Washington saved all of us
now that is true 2015 was not a digital

name:John Oliver

text:dystopia for anyone with the possible
exception of Pizza rat because think
about it the internet put that rat
through hell one cheat day in three
months of eating paleo
and she never hears the end of

name:John Oliver

text:it oh that's right I can't see hashtag
creepy Pelt monster hashtag feminism but
but fine
why is larger argument there he's deeply
disingenuous because he has to know that
Verizon his ex-employer won a lawsuit

name:John Oliver

text:that meant if the FCC wanted strong
enforceable protection it's only real
option was to reclassify the ISPs and
yet he cheerily insists under
questioning there is just no evidence
the cable companies were engaging in

name:John Oliver

text:rampant wrongdoing but to say Comcast
created a new TV series it just so
happened that that competed with a
Netflix series very similarly if these
rules go away how is the house they're
not an incredible incentive for Comcast

name:John Oliver

text:to slow Netflix down coming into my
house and make their video the comcast
video very robust so under that
hypothetical one things that's important
to remember is that it is a hypothetical
that we don't see evidence of that

name:John Oliver

text:happening in the marketplace on a
widespread level but here's the thing
there are multiple examples of ISP
fuckery over the years frizzes a few
years back the Roizen AT&T and t-mobile
at one point shut out Google Wallet from

name:John Oliver

text:their thumbs a product that
coincidentally happened to compete with
their own mobile payment app
and out incidentally that had a
significant flaw it's a little subtle
but see if you can spot it following in

name:John Oliver

text:the footsteps of PayPal and Google
Wallet it's a virtual mobile wallet app
called Isis that is incredible
if only because it leaves it at some
point someone's mom probably sent a text
along the lines of how do I make a

name:John Oliver

text:payment to Isis you have long yes let me
know about Passover and I think you met
me when people complained that they
couldn't use Google Wallet t-mobile sent
out tweaks and this is true like we're
supporting Isis we're really loving Isis

name:John Oliver

text:and we have chosen to work with Isis and
how to roll that out to everyone very
soon and yet despite t-mobile's vocal
support for Isis which is all you should
ever think about now whenever you hear
the word t-mobile or Isis for that

name:John Oliver

text:matter they're essentially the same
thing pardis main argument is that we
don't need title two to have net
neutrality but some of these ideas for
what to have instead are almost
laughably lacks for instance he

name:John Oliver

text:reportedly floated just having ISPs
voluntarily agree not to obstruct or
slow consumer access to web content by
putting that promise in their toes of
service you know the things that no
human being has ever read and that can

name:John Oliver

text:change whenever companies want them to
that idea would basically make net
neutrality as binding as a proposal on
The Bachelor Vanessa I have determined
you to be marginally better for my brand
than Corinne but I reserve the right to

name:John Oliver

text:change these agreements in the future
should ABC ever offered me a slot on
 pile island and entice other big
arguments to remove ISPs from title 2 if
their place is too great a regulatory
burden on companies and that it's

name:John Oliver

text:already caused them to scale back their
investment in broadband networks the
economics are simple here more heavily
you regulate something the less of it
you're going to get so what happened
after the FCC imposed title 2 sure

name:John Oliver

text:enough infrastructure investment
declines ok so what is essentially
suggesting there is that as soon as
title 2 came in come from
said it investing in infrastructure
is way too difficult now we're not doing

name:John Oliver

text:it anymore in fact pull some of the
cable out of the ground we're going back
to the Telegraph but but it is worth
noting infrastructure investment is
harder to measure than you may think
and PI's numbers are in disputed back

name:John Oliver

text:several companies have gone on the
record saying their business has largely
been unaffected by title 2 and maybe the
best way to gauge title twos impact is
to listen to what cable companies told
their own investors to whom they are

name:John Oliver

text:legally obligated to tell the truth so
here is what Verizon told its investors
in 2014 about what the switch to title 2
would mean for them I mean to be real
clear I mean this does not this does not
influence the way we invest I mean we're

name:John Oliver

text:going to continue invest in our networks
and our platforms both in wireless and
wireline FiOS and and where we need to
so so nothing will influence that ok so
that doesn't really sound like net
neutrality was jeopardizing investment

name:John Oliver

text:at all although to be fair that was a
phone call and it was the Rison so it's
entirely possible that every other word
was dropped the fact is the fact is
title 2 is the most solid legal
foundation we have right now for a

name:John Oliver

text:strong enforceable net neutrality
protections so pi saying let's have an
open Internet without it it's like me
saying hey how about you have a gallon
of coffee without your stupid
mug just pour it into your hands and

name:John Oliver

text:trust that you won't get burnt oh and
mr. Chairman I know that you're probably
thinking well you're only making fun of
my mug because you're jealous of it so I
would say why would I be jealous
you want to know what I'm drinking I'm

name:John Oliver

[Music]
see I think will tell you that net
neutrality could be protected by an act
of Congress but I do not particularly
trust this or any Congress to get

name:John Oliver

text:something as complicated as this right
and I definitely wouldn't want the
current president involved as and this
will not surprise you he doesn't seem to
have any idea what any of this is Trump
wants tweeted back in 2014

name:John Oliver

text:Obama's attack on the Internet is
another top-down power grab net
neutrality is the Fairness Doctrine will
target conservative media but that's the
exact opposite of what it did Trump
could not have been more off-base if he

name:John Oliver

text:tweeted net neutrality is the Monroe
Doctrine will target the wu-tang clan so
sadly it seems once more We the People
must take this matter into our own hands
because the FCC are again going to
invite public comment on their website

name:John Oliver

text:and conveniently for them the process is
actually a lot more complicated this
time than it was three years ago you
have to go to FCC gov slash lower case
ecfs slash search - proceedings then
when you get to this page put in the

hit search and on the next page
restoring Internet freedom should be the
only result you see then click on the
link that says Express and then and only
then can you leave your comment and if

name:John Oliver

complicated I'm not doing it don't worry
because that's why we bought the URL go
FCC yourself calm and if you simply go
there it will allow you spread all the
pain where

President Donald Trump is getting away

text:from the Washington heat the president
arrived in New Jersey just a little
while ago to begin a 17 day vacation yes
so he's taking a 17 day vacation from
work which means more importantly
America may be getting a 17 day vacation

access to the nuclear codes and even
worse Wi-Fi so don't relax never relax
your life is still a torture chamber of
fear and panic but that was on Friday
and Trump was leaving at the end of what

name:John Oliver

text:the White House had dubbed American
dream week which Trump chose to mark by
demeaning as many American institutions
as he possibly could beginning with this
after that political speech to the Boy
Scouts last week the president told the

name:John Oliver

text:Wall Street Journal the head of the Boy
Scouts personally called him to say it
was the greatest speech that was ever
made to them and they were very thankful
but actually the speech angered so many
the Boy Scouts were forced to issue an

name:John Oliver

text:apology and yesterday they said there
was no phone call okay so let me get
this straight trunks showed up set a
bunch of crazy shit then lied to make
himself look good I'm honestly not sure
why the Boy Scouts are so upset if your

text:book Trump you get Trump you can't book
Gallagher and then suddenly complain
when you go home covered in melon juice
if you're not familiar with his acts by
now it's kind of on you but what trunk
was just getting started even as that

name:John Oliver

text:controversy was still going a new one
emerged according to Sports
Illustrated's golf comm President Trump
explained the members of one of his golf
clubs that he goes to his own properties
so frequently these days because quote

name:John Oliver

text:that White House is a real dump yes yes
it seems a little odd to call an
objectively grand residence a dump until
you remember that trumps taste in
interior design is a cross between c-3po
s :

name:John Oliver

text:and
a museum when no one has ever learned
anything quickly issued a statement
denying that he had said that tweeting I
love the White House one of the most
beautiful buildings parenthesis homes I

name:John Oliver

text:have ever seen and that is two
qualifiers in one sentence it's the
equivalent of saying I love my wife she
is one of the most beautiful women
parentheses older than 30 I have ever
seen but but the journalist who wrote

name:John Oliver

text:that story stood by expecting the Trump
said this in front of eight or nine
people which is actually a pretty
brilliant way to get trunk to confirm it
estimate the size of his crowd and just
wait for him to correct you know I

name:John Oliver

text:didn't call the White House had dumped
in front of eight or nine people I said
in front of hundreds of thousands of
people all of them returns and all of
them loved it and the next day everyone
called me and told me that no one had

name:John Oliver

text:ever done a better job of calling the
White House a dump because on Thursday
it emerged that in a conversation with
mexico's president he had shit talked an
entire American state while talking
about stopping the flow of drugs into

name:John Oliver

text:the United States the president also
said this and I'm quoting him I won New
Hampshire because New Hampshire is a
drug infested den okay so first
obviously he's wrong about winning New
Hampshire he lost it in the general but

defend the state of New Hampshire I

which claims 140 lives every day or as
one newscaster put it
good evening I'm Anthony Mason and by
the time this broadcast is over three
people will be dead holy shit the only

name:John Oliver

specifically named the who those people
are three people will be dead Jason
Koehler of Waltham Massachusetts Diane
forint of Spokane Washington and you now
combatting America's opioid crisis was

name:John Oliver

text:one of trumps central campaign promises
but I have to say a lot of these
solutions were underwhelming including
one of the key announcements on Thursday
it's really really easy not to take them
and I think that's going to end up being

name:John Oliver

text:a most important thing really tough
really big really great advertising so
we get to people before they start so an
ad campaign I mean sure it is important
not to start abusing opioids but that
doesn't really help the people who are

name:John Oliver

text:already struggling with addiction it's
kind of like seen someone neck deep in
quicksand and then putting up a don't do
quicksand sorry
also the whole ad blitz strategy has
famously been tried and failed before

name:John Oliver

text:with Nancy Reagan's just say no campaign
and yet it still seems to be Trump's
preferred approach going by what
happened at one of his rallies last year
don't take drugs okay
raise your hand raise yeah I promise

name:John Oliver

text:Donald J Trump that I will never take
drugs I don't want to say no alcohol but
take it easy on the alcohol the branch
as you go terrible wedding officiants do
you take this woman I don't want to say
forsaking all others there are gonna be

name:John Oliver

text:others but take it easy on the others
and don't let them call you at home
still you gotta say it is good that the
president is calling attention to the
opioid crisis the problem is attention
is pretty much all he's giving it

name:John Oliver

text:because he didn't put out a detailed
strategy and his splashy a step
declaring it a public health emergency
doesn't actually do very much it will
streamline some access to addiction
treatment but provides few new resources

name:John Oliver

text:financing comes from the public health
emergency fund which has a balance of
just over fifty six thousand dollars the
federal government estimates the crisis
costs 75 billion dollars annually it's
true Trump has finally chimed in with

name:John Oliver

text:his two cents about how to tackle this
crisis and involves a lot eng for the
2.6 million Americans addicted to
opioids literally about two cents each
so Trump's fix for our opioid epidemic
essentially boils down to here's two

thought he couldn't get any worse Moore

statues of whom will inevitably one day

yes it's finally happening
the first charges in the ongoing scandal

a story that like Watergate could well

because one of these idiots slipped on a
banana peel yell something stupid like
our Oh spaghetti oh and accidentally not
democracy over and it is worth looking
at Monday's charges one at a time

name:John Oliver

text:because they're absolutely incredible
and let's start with Paul Manafort
former Trump campaign chairman and his
business partner Rick Gates because the
rap sheet against them is impressive
the 31 page indictment charges that over

text:at least ten years the two men set up a
scheme to hide tens of millions of
dollars in income they received from a
pro-russian Ukrainian political party
prosecutors allege the scheme involved
hiding that foreign work funneling more

through unreported foreign bank accounts
laundering tens of millions of dollars
and lying to the IRS and to the Justice
Department wow that is a lot of charges
and Trump must be furious with them not

name:John Oliver

allegedly lied to the government before
where they pretended to have less money
than they did because I'm pretty sure
that that violates the tenets of
whatever sticky back issue of fuckable

name:John Oliver

text:yachts magazine that chunk considers his
code of ethics okay and while they deny
all charges the details here are damning
because according to the prosecutors not
all the money was squirreled away in
shell companies and overseas bank

according to the indictment man afford

right except you're not really draining
this one so much as you are moving it a

ruin our little lives on the system in a

what is the swamp this swamps for me
mainstream is yes you almost mail it

it's the elites that look down on a

you're mainstream you can't be elite by

that as a congressman he got sixty

of administration's in that they are

everything in their path and will almost
certainly eventually hire terror read
this this week has been dominated by the
continuing fallout of last week's FBI
raid on Michael Cohen and while no

name:John Oliver

yet there is already one question on
people's lips will president Donald
Trump's personal lawyer flip there's
this question of will he flip this Cohen
gotta flip and blow Michael Cohen flip

name:John Oliver

text:will the fixer flip he's almost
certainly gonna flip on Donald Trump has
he flipped already what will cause him
to flip what has he been up to now
you'll notice that everyone just skips
the question does Trump have something

name:John Oliver

text:to hide and goes straight to will this
guy hide it for him which does actually
make sense because at this point the
only genuinely surprising headline would
be bombshell Trump did totally normal
and legal stuff for fall to you

name:John Oliver

text:and while the president insists that
Cohen won't flips all of those closest
to Trump like one of his other longtime
lawyers Jay Goldberg see it very
differently and the reason I know this
is he articulated those concerns on

name:John Oliver

text:television in the creepiest possible way
well he's of a type that I've recognized
in the past as one not suited to stand
up to the rigors of jail life I think in
many ways and it's difficult to say this
prison is has a racial overtone and the

name:John Oliver

text:person like Michael doesn't see himself
walking down Broadway while people are
clamoring you're gonna be my wife I'm
not remotely surprised that Donald Trump
hired him as his lawyer because it takes
a questionable lawyer to make a prison

name:John Oliver

text:rape joke
it takes a Donald Trump lawyer to
somehow turn that prison rape joke
racist because he's essentially implying
there that Michael Cohen is potentially
fine with being sexually assaulted were

name:John Oliver

text:it not for the unfortunate racial
overtones there but let's let's put all
that aside and instead focus on a
lesser-known member of the Trump circus
Ryan Zinke the Secretary of the Interior
a man doing a job that Trump definitely

name:John Oliver

text:fully understands I have to speak really
talk about a very special guy that I
made Secretary of the Interior does he
know the interior he knows it he loves
it he loves seeing it and riding on it
talking about he said less like a

of his cabinet more like a guy at a yard

included land sacred to loaded local
Native American tribes by more than
three quarters and what many said that

industries think he used his quad
patience to push back hard I'm a
geologist I can assure you that oil and
gas in bears ears was not part of my
decision matrix a geologist would tell

name:John Oliver

text:you there is little if any oil and gas
the geology is clearing it you want a
quart thinking they're mentioning that
he was a geologist is something that he
suggested at least 40 times in public
including under oath before Congress

name:John Oliver

text:which makes it a little awkward but this
week in most that Ryan sink II is not in
fact a geologist he has never been a
geologist what he did do was major in
geology in college which does not make
you a geologist all it does is qualify

name:John Oliver

text:you to watch the movie San Andreas and
whisper to your friends it wouldn't

has a pattern of inflating the
importance of past glories no matter how
insignificant for example when he ran

all politicians self mythologized of
course but Zinke has a real flair for
creative license for example he served
as a Navy Seal which is genuinely

name:John Oliver

text:impressive but here is how his service
was described in an ad for his book
Zinke rose through the ranks to be a
commander at the same SEAL team that
killed bin Laden
so authoritarian are obsessed with

name:John Oliver

text:projecting strength and they often tell
their citizens that that strength is
necessary to protect them from what well
that actually brings us to their second

name:John Oliver

text:you would hope that an independent press
or an opposition party might push back

brings us to our final key trait which
is dismantling institutions because as
they gain power or ferret Aryans will

text:try to weaken any check on them
journalists in authoritarian regimes are
frequently threatened imprisoned killed
or in Putin's Russia have tragic
accidents that hopefully others may

structures of government in Turkey China
Hungary and Venezuela have all been
modified to consolidate power under

name:John Oliver

text:their leaders and as Poland becomes
increasingly authoritarian their de
facto leader no longer has to worry
about the country's highest judge or
indeed many other judges because he his
party cleverly managed to force them out

name:John Oliver

text:simply by lowering their retirement age
and when some judges showed up to work
anyway in protest a government official
had this patronizing response they can
enter the building they can be their
vacant they can be there as guests but

name:John Oliver

text:they cannot work as judges because they
are retired you know I really don't
blame those judges for being furious
about that because as we all now know
there are only two ways to really piss
off a judge one forced them into

-It's nice to have you
back on the air.
You returned from
a little bit of a break.
I know you don't really
ever take a break.

name:John Oliver

text:-No, we work through the breaks.
We were planning some ridiculous
stories for later this year.
-Yes. And I think --
no one works harder than you
or your staff.
And so it's very hard
to catch you on vacation.
-Yeah.
-Sometimes I will see you

name:John Oliver

text:and I'll think, "Oh, you didn't
have a show last week."
Maybe you'll be refreshed, and
you just always look exhausted.
-No, yeah.
[ Laughter ]
That's something to do with work
and I do have
resting exhausted face, anyway.
[ Laughter ]

name:John Oliver

text:People do -- even when
I come back from vacation,
sometimes people will go,
"Everything all right?
It's tough right now, isn't it?"
Well, this is three days
on a beach.
-You never --
[ Laughter ]
-Okay.
-As you say,

name:John Oliver

text:you never stop working,
but what you do lose
when you're on a break is
the outlet to process the news.
-Yeah.
-I know even when we have
a couple weeks off, that
is the hardest part for me.
Can you appreciate being
unplugged from the news at all,
or do you just miss being able
to talk about it?

name:John Oliver

text:-It's nice in general.
It's nice to unplug from
something that's poisonous.
But the problem is,
when there's poison around,
you kind of want to know
what's happening.
So, no. It feels reckless
and irresponsible to say,
"I won't concern myself
with the fact

name:John Oliver

text:that America is destroying
itself.
I'll surprise myself
three months later
to see what's happened."
No, so, it's nice to have
an outlet again.
Do you struggle?
-I -- well --
What I found -- I do.
-Really? Do you?

name:John Oliver

text:-No, I mutter to myself
a lot more when we
don't have the show.
-Oh, really?
-You know, because this is my --
this is like a very polite way
to do what
would just be muttering
if I didn't have a TV show.

name:John Oliver

text:-Yeah,
it's a very erudite mutter
that you vomit into a camera.
-Yeah.
-So you just walk around --
-I just walk around town --
-"Why was he at an omelet bar?"
[ Laughter ]
-Here's the thing.
And you know, you guys
obviously do stories
that are sort of longer tales

name:John Oliver

text:as opposed to just talking about
what happened yesterday.
-Right.
-What happened yesterday,
if you have a week off,
you don't have to pay
that much attention,
because by the following Monday,
nothing that matters -- nothing
that happened matters anymore.

name:John Oliver

text:-That's it. That is the sense
where time has kind of changed.
-Yeah.
-And it used to be that you
could assume that if something
happened in the week
that you're still in, it would
have a place in people's memory.
Now, 72 hours is a long time.
-Yeah.
[ Laughter ]
-So often we find ourselves

name:John Oliver

text:saying, "Oh, and he did this
at the start of this week,
this human week."
-Yes.
-This actual week
that we started on Monday.
And so, yeah. There's a lot --
generally we don't talk about
anything in the week
that doesn't happen
kind of Thursday night, Friday.
There's no point.

name:John Oliver

text:-You know, it's nice --
you do provide a nice service
in that obviously things
are crazy here right now.
You do remind the world
that other places are crazy.
-Yeah, but that's a tough sell,
though. That's the problem.
So it's difficult when you're
doing international stories
on the show, like last year,
we wanted to do a show

name:John Oliver

text:about the Brazilian election
and it's a tough sell to say,
"I know things are rough
in America right now,
but we need to talk
about Brazil."
And you can kind of feel going,
"Not [bleep] now we don't."
[ Laughter ]
It's like saying to someone
whose house is on fire,

name:John Oliver

text:"There is a house on fire
three streets away."
Any other time, I would give
a [bleep] about that.
But my possessions are burning.
So it's tough to kind of say,
"we need to talk about Brazil,"
and not have that sense
of "Do we?"
-Yeah.
-Do we definitely?

name:John Oliver

text:-You talked about Brexit
last night.
Obviously, you have
a connection to that.
-Yes, yeah.
-Do you feel like that's a story
that people here have any sense
of exactly how insane it is?
-Well, you can -- Broadly,
you can get a sense
of how insane it is, just from
being secure in the knowledge

name:John Oliver

text:that it's [bleep] crazy
what's happening.
Now, as you go into actually
what is happening,
the details of it are so absurd
that it kind of exacerbates
the insanity,
but it does take
a long time to understand.
To understand exactly
why Northern Ireland

name:John Oliver

text:and the Northern Ireland border
is so critical here to this deal
that isn't actually a deal,
it's a deal just to get to
an interim period
to get to the deal --
It's fun to understand all of
that if you are into masochism.
[ Laughter ]
But you can just reassure
that what Britain is doing

name:John Oliver

text:is driving itself off a cliff.
They are "Thelma & Louise"-ing
themselves off a cliff.
-The next cliff opportunity
we have here
seems to be the 2020 election.
-Yes.
-That seems to be
a good cliff opportunity.
-Yeah.

name:John Oliver

text:That's definitely a good time
to look over the cliff.
"I don't know, we somehow
lived through the last one.
Maybe we can fly."
[ Laughter ]
-Yeah.
[ Cheers and applause ]
"We're going to live forever!"
-Exactly.

name:John Oliver

text:-You -- Obviously,
one of the things --
I mean, and a lot of people
are announcing
and cable news is certainly
doing a lot of coverage
of 2020 already.
How do you feel about that?
A little early?
-It's a little early, right?
Because the bar
is pretty low now.

name:John Oliver

text:Whenever anyone announces
for president, I just go,
"Sure, fine. Yeah.
Add it to the list."
You're fine.
Kamala Harris, great.
Bernie sanders, great.
A tortoise walking across
an abandoned
Wendy's parking lot,

name:John Oliver

text:has he got an exploratory
committee?
You would work, as well.
[ Laughter ]
The bar is so low.
So all they're going to do now
is just announce
they're running for President
and then go raise money.
So there is not much
to see there.

name:John Oliver

text:-Yeah.
-So, yeah, it's dangerous
I think giving it too much
attention right now
when there is plenty
of other [bleep]
that we should be looking at.
-What about this idea
of you want to --
you know, you can get caught up
in the everyday

name:John Oliver

text:of what's happening
with this presidency.
You don't want to
get complacent.
You don't want to get
desensitized to the idea
that madness is happening.
But you also don't want
to be screaming
and yelling all the time.

name:John Oliver

text:Like, how do you find
a balance there?
-I mean, I don't know. That's --
I mean, that's a kind of
existential question, isn't it?
How do we all seek happiness
right now
that isn't, at its root,
fraudulent?
[ Light laughter,
audience "ohhs" ]

name:John Oliver

text:Oh, God, that was
a truly depressing "ohh"
from the audience.
[ Laughter ]
"Listen, we're just trying to
have a night out in New York,
dude.
I didn't come here
for nihilism."
[ Cheers and applause ]

name:John Oliver

text:-They were like,
"John Oliver is on.
He's gonna give us
an update on Brazil."
[ Laughter ]
-"Now he's saying we're all dust
in the wind of history."
Yeah, it's difficult.
It's difficult.
I think that the problem
is that at the moment, like,

name:John Oliver

text:not only with Trump,
who is president,
so you have to pay attention
to him
like you would pay attention
to a bull in a china shop.
But also, the new candidates,
it's a --
it kind of shows that we're
concentrating too much
on personalities right now,

name:John Oliver

text:which is hard to criticize
when those personalities
are in the White House.
But we do have systemic problems
underneath them.
So I can't really get excited
about new candidates yet
because it's 20 months away
from the election.
-Yeah, it's a long time away.
-It's a long time.

name:John Oliver

text:and it was look particularly grim with
yesterday's anti-semitic attack leaving
1110 at a Pittsburgh synagogue this was
just days after an apparently racially
motivated shooting in Louisville and a
series of package bombs being sent two

name:John Oliver

text:prominent critics of Donald Trump it has
been a time for sober reflection all if
you're Fox News discussing those package
bombs a time for wild speculation
because before the suspect was even
arrested they were giving airtime to a

name:John Oliver

text:truly ludicrous theory you talked in
your in your notes earlier about the
potential that it could be a false flag
we cannot rule out that it's a false
flag operation I feel these are false
flag bombing at the risk of sounding

name:John Oliver

text:like a far right-wing lunatic I'd have
to say that I believe that this whole
thing was an elaborate hoax yeah here's
the thing about that sounding like a far
right-wing lunatic is not really a risk
for the Fox News brand is it there's

name:John Oliver

text:more of a guarantee you'd be like if
Tony Bennett started every song with at
the risk of making your grandma wet what
are you talking about Tony we all know
that's going to happen it's specifically
what you're here to do now once the

name:John Oliver

text:suspect was found and it was clear not
just in the bombs were real but that he
was very much a trump supporter Geraldo
apologized tweeting never mind
outsmarted myself encountering false
flag operations how can I just say that

name:John Oliver

text:outsmarted myself is a brilliant way to
say that you did something incredibly
stupid wow I really outsmarted myself
this morning when I accidentally ate
kitty litter
instead of Grape Nuts I don't know

name:John Oliver

text:thinking as I choose the clumps I truly
am two steps ahead of me
but incredibly even after the suspect
suspects motivations were clear some
Trump supporters remained insistence
there was more to this story

name:John Oliver

text:okay so Obama flew to Florida mail to
bond to himself in Washington then flew
back just in time to avoid it all to
frame this guy now I'm not saying that
that man's theory doesn't have any holes
in it but at least we can all agree he

name:John Oliver

text:really outsmarted Geraldo Rivera let's
move on to Saudi Arabia the country with
bans on pork alcohol and porn or as it's
known in America a Florida breakfast
Saudi Arabia is continuing to deal with
the ongoing fallout from the death of

after entering the Saudi Arabian
consulate in Istanbul which reportedly
also contained 15 Saudi operatives who's
flown in with an autopsy specialist and
a bone saw the Saudis initially insisted

life but now admits that they
incorrectly remembered what happened or
dismembered if you will their story
instead became that he'd been killed but
for good reason

name:John Oliver

text:they say discussions led to a brawl and
he died in a fistfight yeah a fistfight
apparentiy have started when they had a
disagreement over whether or not
khashoggi should be murdered in cold
blood you see he didn't think so but the

name:John Oliver

another now of course this story was a

Post tweeted utter bullshit which should

it's certainly better than using their

dishonest wood demon from a children's

now the Saudis then abandoned that story
and suggested that the killing may have
been premeditated which was obvious from
the start especially as it now appears
the killers had the laziest of

Khashoggi had left the consulate safely
CNN aired what appears to be
surveillance video described to them by
a Turkish source as one of the key
suspects dressed into Shoji's clothes

name:John Oliver

pathetic
for start khashoggi is bald and the body
double has a full head of hair if you're
picking a body double for someone you
better make sure they look exactly like

name:John Oliver

text:that person that is why my body double
is this owl the resemblance is uncanny
you can't even tell which one is the
real hour after the Ralphs inducing
Devil's Triangle that was last week
it really would have been nice if things

name:John Oliver

text:have been a little bit better this week
but they frankly worked at the UN
released a climate report that said we
may only have two good decades left that
study was then enthusiastically
co-signed but one of the strongest

text:hurricanes ever to make landfall in the
US then whatever the living fuck this
was happened and then there was this
neil armstrong he's the man that planted
the flag think of that on the face of
the moon he planted that flag that

name:John Oliver

text:American flag right on the face of the
moon there was no kneeling there was no
no
there was no games there was no games
boom how are you tying the NFL protest
to Neil Armstrong you all right there

name:John Oliver

playing the national anthem there was no
football game scheduled in DC of
Tranquility that day oh one more thing
no black astronauts have recently been
shot by moon cops so really not the

name:John Oliver

text:essential ingredients had come together
at that point the midterms which are now
less than a month away the ads are
starting to roll out intensely and some
are undeniably pro-trump like this one
from Florida gubernatorial candidate Ron

name:John Oliver

text:DeSantis everyone knows my husband Ron
De Santis is endorsed by President Trump
he's also an amazing dad Ron loves
playing with the kids build the wall he
reads stories then mr. Trump said you're
fired okay

name:John Oliver

text:first I think that's borderline child
abuse right there and second I didn't
think this could be done but he produced
an ad essentially saying the president
slogans are fairy tales for naive infant
children and somehow intended it in a

name:John Oliver

text:good way
now the one thing I will say for that ad
is it's a rare example of positive
messaging because there is a growing
concern that this is campaigning is
getting too nasty

name:John Oliver

text:last Sunday Eric Holder faced criticism
after suggesting Democrats change their
motto from when they go low we go high
to when they go low we kick them which
is both a massive pivot on political
messaging and also happens to be my

name:John Oliver

text:strategy for dealing with squirrels when
they go low I'll kick em when they go
high I'll SWAT them and if they swarm I
do a move I like to call helicopter
fists now now Trump the Grand Wizard of
civil discourse called holders comments

name:John Oliver

text:disgusting which is clearly ridiculous
coming from him but it's also pretty
hypocritical from the Republican Party
in general because just the day after
Trump said that their candidate for
Pennsylvania governor said this Governor

name:John Oliver

text:wolf let me tell you between now and
November 6 you better put a catcher's
mask on your face because I'm gonna stop
all over your face with golf spikes
because I'm gonna win
this for the state of Pennsylvania and

name:John Oliver

text:what throwing you out of office because
you know what I'm sick and tired of your
negative ads how can you be anti
negative ads when your entire ad feels
like a man getting into a fight in a
garage put on a catcher's mitt cuz I'm

name:John Oliver

text:gonna stomp on your face with golf
cleats bring you down with a leaf rake
jam your feet into a snow blower and run
you're all like one my wife's 2015 Volvo
station wagon you worthless piece of
shit

name:John Oliver

text:I'm not a fan of attack ads they are
never pretty but every once in a while
someone comes along and truly elevates
the form and my favorite ad that has
come out this campaign season was one in
Texas which really strikes at the

name:John Oliver

text:essential essence of Ted Cruz somebody
left something on my door the other day
is that Ted Cruz turpis Texas come on if
somebody call my wife a dog and says my
daddy was in on the Kennedy
assassination I wouldn't be kissing

name:John Oliver

text:their ass you dragged her ass out by the
woodshed and kicked their ass Ted come
on it's just his name and yet somehow
that final kid might be the meanest
thing ever said about Ted Cruz that's
devastating honestly that ad could have

name:John Oliver

text:had exactly the same impact if it were
just three seconds long come on here
concerns Brazil home of that one famous
statue that I don't know the name of
because I'm too embarrassed to Google
come at me bro Jesus statue

name:John Oliver

text:we've we tend to think of Brazil has
been synonymous with soccer beaches and
of course the Rio Carnival the exuberant
celebration that has inspired breathless
newsreel reports since the 1930s down in
Rio they're turning night into day it's

name:John Oliver

text:the final day of the big carnival and a
mere couple of million Carioca
Brazilians - you are out on a great
Whoopie yes there's fun seeking Carioca
is that having themselves a great would
be an excitable group of people they are

name:John Oliver

text:what a fun bunch now I will be the first
to admit the tone of British news
newsreels in the past is breathtakingly
condescending although before you get
too judgmental you might want to see an
American one from the same era Brazil

name:John Oliver

text:itself is larger than the whole of the
United States and it has millions of
acres of land that no white man has ever
seen that basic geography lesson just
took a pretty racist turn the point is
none of us have our hands clean anyway

name:John Oliver

text:the reason the reason that I want to
talk about Brazil tonight is that they
had a massive election today the first
of two rounds of voting to elect among
other things a new president and while
results are coming in as we speak it is

name:John Oliver

text:worth talking about it for a number of
reasons first a Brazilian politics can
be a lot of fun as we've mentioned
before broadcasters have to provide free
airtime to political parties and some
candidates use that airtime to really

name:John Oliver

text:fuck around over the years they've been
ads for a guy dressed as a grasshopper a
dancing chicken a small elderly version
of Robin a surprisingly healthy-looking
asama bin laden Captain America a husky
spider-man and my favorite Geraldo

name:John Oliver

text:Wolverine
now I know what you're thinking if
Hillary adjust on that things would have
been a lot different well maybe maybe
maybe but the point we'll never know
will we

name:John Oliver

text:we'll never know but this election has
been crazy for reasons that go well
beyond novelty Wolverines and if you're
thinking why should I care about it well
first that's a pretty hostile way to put
it but second Brazil is home to 200

name:John Oliver

text:million people it's the fifth largest
country on Earth and they could be on
the brink of massive change because
Brazilians are pissed off right now
one recent survey found that 95 percent
of them say their country is headed in

name:John Oliver

text:the wrong direction as you will see
tonight there is a very real chance that
they're about to elect a dangerous
ideologue with potentially disastrous
consequences so let us look at why that
is the case and the first thing that you

name:John Oliver

text:really need to understand is that Brazil
is just emerging from the worst
recession in its history millions are
out of work and in some regions crime is
out of control last year there were more
than 63,000 homicides in Brazil

name:John Oliver

text:that's more than Europe and the United
States combined and if you live in Rio
you're probably acutely aware of that
fact period percent of the citizen that
lives in real was in a middle of a brush
fire once in the last year 30% were in

name:John Oliver

text:the middle of crossfire at that point
Rio's Weather Channel should probably
include crossfire in their forecasts
today is looking partly cloudy with a 30
percent charge about hailstorm of
bullets so maybe bring a light flak

name:John Oliver

text:jacket with you and the general
dissatisfaction about crime has been
exacerbated by a gigantic corruption
scandal arising from the investigation
known as Operation car wash and I
realize that doesn't sound like the name

name:John Oliver

text:of a major investigation it sounds like
a Netflix original comedy starring Kevin
James that for some reason you'll be
recommended because you watch one
episode of chef's table I don't know I
don't know what your algorithm is

name:John Oliver

text:Netflix but I fucking hate it
no no operation carwash and the scandal
uncovered by it is way too complicated
to get into now suffice to say that it
involves this gas station these two
companies inflated contracts bribes and

name:John Oliver

text:kickbacks to government officials and an
elderly gentleman who flew around the
world with bricks of cash shrink wrapped
and strapped beneath thigh high socks
and a Spanx like vest which really
explains this year's hottest Halloween

name:John Oliver

text:costume sexy carwash co-conspirator and
look the sheer scale of this scandal is
absolutely mind-blowing as the Elise
prosecutor will tell you how does
carwash compare to Watergate car wash is
much much bigger bigger than Watergate

name:John Oliver

text:much bigger we already have charged more
than two hundred people for hundreds of
crimes the amounts of bribes paid go up
to about two billion dollars okay so
first aside from being deeply
disrespectful have you is just not the

name:John Oliver

text:answer of an innocent person if you ask
someone if they ever blew a dog and I go
I don't know have you blew a dog he blew
a fucking dog in in all likelihood not
just one either and that surly tone was
emblematic of Cavanaugh's demeanor

name:John Oliver

text:throughout the hearing not the tone of a
man who hopes to one day have the honor
of serving on the Supreme Court but the
tone of someone who feels entitled to be
honest and frankly can't believe that
you're being such a dick about this and

name:John Oliver

text:that actually does make some sense
because this is a man who has had every
imaginable advantage his elite high
school and this is true has its own nine
hole golf course now am i saying that
someone who went to a school with its

name:John Oliver

text:own golf course should not be on a
Supreme Court yeah yeah I think I didn't
just rely on belligerents to a few
thoughts charges he brought evidence
specifically a calendar from 1982 about
which he was and I know this will shock

name:John Oliver

text:you weirdly emotional why did I keep
calendars my dad started to keeping
detailed calendars of his life in 1978
he did so is both a calendar and a diary
Christmas time we sit around and he
would gales those old stories old

name:John Oliver

text:milestones old weddings old events from
his calendars I know it may seem cruel
to make fun of a man crying over his
late father's calendars but what if I
were to tell you that his father was
still alive and was sitting won't be

name:John Oliver

text:appointed that is why I am now
completely comfortable saying that every
Christmas we'd gather round and dad
would regardless withhold events from
his calendar is the single weirdest
fucking thing started keeping calendars

name:John Oliver

text:in 1978 when Cavanaugh was 13 meaning he
would have been 14 at the time his staff
had even a single calendar to read to
his children fraud and an adult man
reading last year's calendar to his 14
year old son is literally the saddest

name:John Oliver

text:Christmas I could imagine other than
being one of the innocent people who
gets murdered in the movie die heart
that is literally the only other example
and the truth is
Cavanaugh's calendar may not have

name:John Oliver

text:actually helped him because while he
told the panel he never attended a
gathering like the one dr. Ford
describes in her allegation in fact his
calendar shows at least one similar
events with at least two of the people

name:John Oliver

text:thought named in her letter and come
about misrepresenting the truth actually
became something of a really troubling
pattern for instance he repeatedly made
this strong claim to poke holes in Fords
story I just want you emphasize all four

name:John Oliver

text:witnesses who are allegedly at the event
have said it didn't happen including dr.
Ford's longtime friend miss Kaiser
except this 53 year old frat pledge is
actually significantly mistaking the
facts there because in reality three of

name:John Oliver

text:those people merely said that they
didn't recall the party as described and
Ford's friend miss Kaiser did
specifically say she believes Ford's
allegation and the fourth person there
is Cavanaugh himself so Cavanaugh just

name:John Oliver

text:wildly mischaracterized evidence
that is one thing a judge really should
know not to do is basically that and
don't tuck your robes into your blue
jeans because it's objectively a bad
look then there knows the fact that that

name:John Oliver

text:all a cabin hogs talk of his wholesome
teenage years spent respecting women for
their friendships and doing sick reps in
Tobin's dad's house his high school
yearbook tells a very different story
for instance he and his bro friends brag

name:John Oliver

text:about being renata alumni referring to a
girl that they knew now Cavanaugh claims
that that was completely asexual and
just clumsily intended to show affection
and that this she was one of us which is
a little hard to believe given that a

name:John Oliver

text:Renata only just found out about it and
said the insinuation is horrible hurtful
and simply untrue and P if it was just
affection for a friend where's the
Alumni Society for Amy or June or
Kristen implausible explanations for

name:John Oliver

text:other terms in the yearbook specifically
those commonly associated with drinking
or sex have you I don't know if it's
booked or boofed how do you pronounce
that yeah you actually don't I mean it's
something that everyone naturally

name:John Oliver

text:assumes but it isn't weird to hear it
out loud it's like a Disney World park
attendant saying hey kids whose have
their photo taken with a 30 year old
theater major who couldn't hack it in
the industry and who now wears a

name:John Oliver

text:full-body man suit I mean there's no new
information there but it is still
unpleasant to listen to but just
focusing on the famous alligators in
Trump's swamp is missing some of the
most important damage that's getting

name:John Oliver

text:done by lesser-known bureaucrats and to
illustrate that let's look at two
agencies tonight first the EPA now for a
year it was run by Scott Pruitt who
became a household name for doing things
like spending forty thousand dollars on

name:John Oliver

text:a soundproof booth in his office trying
to get the CEO of chick-fil-a to give
his wife a franchise and demanding an
expensive 24/7 security detail then
making it drive him around town to see
which which Carlton had the lotion he

name:John Oliver

text:light
is simply insane because everyone knows
the best lotion comes from La Quinta Inn
that's right if you want to masturbate
with hotel lotion choose like heater I
thought their slogan says lucky to have

name:John Oliver

text:the luncheon that will help New Year's
was correct left there were not as many
flashy headlines about the EPA but that
itself is actually dangerous because he
was not an isolated case nearly half of
the political appointees hired by Trump

name:John Oliver

text:at the EPA have strong industry ties and
the guy who replaced Pruitt is not much
of an improvement
the man tapped to be Pruitt replacement
Andrew wheeler a man who Forbes says
earned more than seven hundred thousand

name:John Oliver

text:dollars in recent years as wait for it a
call obvious yeah at this point though
CNN you really don't need to ask the
American people to wait for it surprise
is just one more emotion that Trump has
completely destroyed along with joy

name:John Oliver

text:Wonder and the ability to see someone
wearing a red hat from behind without
mehndi saying god damn it
phone lobbies we push hard to roll back
environmental regulations impacting the
industry in fact here he is as a

name:John Oliver

text:lobbyist meeting with Rick Perry doing
exactly that and little over a year
later he is running the EPA and
dismantling the very regulations he
lobbies against which is ridiculous it's
like handing your cities waste

name:John Oliver

text:management over to a seagull so let me
get this straight the new strategies we
just throw our trash everywhere and
leave it strewn around and we should
have more french fries in our garbage
how the fuck are you in charge but that

name:John Oliver

text:is actually a really good example of how
once Trump's swamp starts seeping in it
can filter all the way down an
organization and for just how deep it
can go simply look at the Department of
the Interior on this show we've lavished

name:John Oliver

text:quite a bit of attention on Trump's
appointee to head them Ryan's inky which
is understandable he rode a horse to
work on his first day at the department
he swung parent pence around like a bag
of potatoes despite the fact he is very

name:John Oliver

text:much not a geologist he has a weird
habit of doing this that's the
questionnaire Sonoma geologist I'm a
geologist I'm a geologist I'm a
geologist I'm a geologist he's not a
geologist walking around saying I own

name:John Oliver

text:crackers saltines cheez-its you name it
I own it not always the crackers of
course Neal am i Bill Gates
jinke has also taken 66 personal days in
his first year and a half on the job and
has been a subject of no less than 15

name:John Oliver

text:investigations and reportedly he may
actually be gone any day now but even if
that happens serious problems will
remain because the swamp runs deep
interior is a massive department and
there is real power at every level

name:John Oliver

text:I'll show you look at this
organizational charts a beloved inky and
the deputy secretary and the assistant
secretary for land and minerals
management you will find a very
important subdivision called the Bureau

name:John Oliver

text:of safety and environmental enforcement
or Bessey which is in charge of safety
on offshore oil mix and I know what
you're thinking
safety on offshore oil rigs wouldn't
regulatory oversight of any resource

name:John Oliver

text:development on the outer continental
shelf fall under the jurisdiction of the
minerals management service
wouldn't that be where the
responsibility lies John to which I say
congratulations on being a sex God until

name:John Oliver

text:2010 when there was that catastrophe at
Deepwater Horizon
this is the video BP did not want the
world to see
toxic blend of oil and gas spewing from
its broken well at the bottom of the

text:Gulf of Mexico how good was a star is
born it was amazing it was amazing it's
still on my heart
Bradley Cooper had a hold of my soul
there for a little while it's it it is
beyond great maybe it's time let the

name:John Oliver

text:always there
Bradley Cooper oh my gosh yeah that guy
loves it and he's the center for the
Dallas Cowboys no one doesn't like a
star is born it's the one movie that
even Neil deGrasse Tyson can't ruin John

name:John Oliver

text:I had a small issue with the film see if
you want to know how a star is actually
born you start with a gas cloud shut up
shut up shut up Neil deGrasse Tyson let
this be the one thing about stars you
know fuck Keenan ruined

name:John Oliver

text:yeah unfortunately we're not talking
about a star is born tonight in fact
we're gonna talk about the exact
opposite of that movie the troubling
rise of authoritarian leaders around the
world a lot of them there are the ones

name:John Oliver

text:that you instinctively think about like
a Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping who've
been steadily consolidating their power
there's the re-election of strongmen
like Hungary's Viktor Orban and turkeys
worship Diwan and then there's what

name:John Oliver

text:happened just last month in the world's
fifth largest country brazil has a new
president becoming a latest nation to
elect a far-right leader extreme right
populist bullsháá Niro has insulted the
country's military dictatorships

name:John Oliver

text:advocated torture and threatened to
destroy jail or drive his political
opponents into exile is calling for
unity oh that's nice
he's calling for unity is he yet the
problem is he expressed an affection for

name:John Oliver

text:torture and dictatorship before that and
political platforms are a bit like
tinder profiles once you advocate
torture it doesn't really matter what
else you say it's all people are going
to remember and for good reason and not

name:John Oliver

text:what what well no to authoritarian
leaders are the same the global trend
toward them is alarming especially
because in many cases people are
actively choosing them a report recently
concluded that one-third of the world's

name:John Oliver

text:population lives in a backsliding
democracy and that is why there's a
pretty good chance that you may have
been watching the news at some point
this year and found yourself saying what
the fuck is happening to the world and

name:John Oliver

text:why so tonight let's look at three
common traits that authoritarian leaders
tend to have to try and figure out what
can make them so appealing to people and
to what extent this country is in danger
of heading in the same direction and the

name:John Oliver

text:first trait is projecting strength
authoritarians tend to love grand
displays of force like the military
parades featuring weaponry that you've
seen places like China North Korea
Venezuela and Russia where they'll even

name:John Oliver

text:sometimes throw in a surprise musical
number
[Music]
yeah might have warning there Russia
that's what musicals are like when you
don't allow gay people like those serve

name:John Oliver

text:a purpose as many authoritarians project
strength out of a real concern that they
may be seen as illegitimate in kind of
the same way that a man who is insecure
about his penis buys a motorcycle or
takes up bodybuilding or invents the

name:John Oliver

text:tesla Nasima how weird is it but
projecting military strength often isn't
enough men you authoritarians tend to
conflate their country's national
identity with their personal identity so
they individually need to appear strong

name:John Oliver

text:two most obvious example of this is
Vladimir Putin who's taken so many
glamor shots
there are calendars of him that the
latest ones feature him cuddling
leopards taking a shirtless ice bath and

name:John Oliver

text:sunbathing which cool but but but he's
not alone there's also Chechen leader
Ramzan Kadyrov's ridiculous workout
videos which I frankly cannot recommend
highly enough it's like watching a
Keebler Elf get ripped although my

name:John Oliver

text:favorite example of this is also
actually the status just watch as the
authoritarian president of Turkmenistan
forces his cabinet to watch him take a
gold bar and do whatever this is
Wow when you go to work tomorrow and

name:John Oliver

text:you're forced to laugh at your
supervisors dumb jokes just spare a
thought for the people who have to give
a standing ovation to their boss for
lifting a golden curtain right
-I'm assuming you get asked
something that we get asked

name:John Oliver

text:all the time, which is, "Does
Trump make your job easier?"
-Mm-hmm, yeah, which is --
It's very hard
for people to understand
just how viscerally upsetting
that question is.
-Yeah.
-Because it doesn't.
It makes it harder.

name:John Oliver

text:My wife, in the past,
has had to pull me away
from entirely well-meaning
people in the street, saying,
"Well, I guess it just
writes itself, doesn't it?"
and I'll say,
"I'll tell you whether
it [bleep] writes itself or --
No, I'm talking to the lady!

name:John Oliver

text:She wants to know
how easy it is.
I'll [bleep] tell her
how easy it is."
[ Laughter ]
No, it's -- it's harder.
It's harder.
Because, um, you know,
it's easy to do bad comedy,
because you just
need to repeat what he says,

name:John Oliver

text:and that's not a joke.
That's repetition.
-Yeah.
-Whereas comedy,
especially if you want
to try and do something
that's not just happening
online all the time,
is an effort.
I'm not telling you something
you don't already feel

name:John Oliver

text:with every fiber
of your exhausted being.
-Yeah.
You do a lot of deep dives
on stories that are
a little uncovered,
but you do spend a few minutes,
I feel, like,
covering the Trump news
at the top of your show,
usually.

name:John Oliver

text:And it seems like
you pick up --
'Cause you go on Sunday,
you kind of pick up
the end-of-the-week news.
-Yeah. So we literally started
thinking, at one point --
What time do you tape?
Because it's probably
about 5:30, right?

name:John Oliver

text:-We tape at 6:30, yeah, but
we're done at 5:30, yeah.
-Exactly.
So, about 5:30 on a Thursday,
at that point, you have dealt
with the fire-hosable [bleep]
to the extent that you can,
at which point the depressing
relay baton is put over to us.
So, from Thursday
at 5:30 onwards,

name:John Oliver

text:it's our turn to open our mouth
and take that fire hose in.
[ Laughter ]
Listen
to that revolted response.
"Was that analogy necessary?"
[ Laughter and applause ]
-Well, I want to speak about
another analogy of sorts.
This was a couple years ago.

name:John Oliver

text:You said that America was
entering their Fat Elvis stage.
-No, that was more
than a couple of --
That was a long time ago.
-That was really --
It was a long time ago.
-I think that was pre-Obama.
-Wow.
-The argument then
was saying that, yeah, exactly,

name:John Oliver

text:you were kind of Elvis
in his Vegas years back then.
Still objectively great...
-Yeah.
-...but you could sense
the sadness coming.
[ Laughter ]
-And that has really
kind of followed through.
-Well, it has followed through.

name:John Oliver

text:'Cause at that point,
I thought that was as silly
as it could get, and that
now seems a quaint idea,
because I don't know what period
of Elvis you're in right now,
but I think he's about to reach
for the flusher.
[ Laughter ]
-Or we've now gone past --
This is --

name:John Oliver

text:In our analogy, Elvis lived.
-I think that's right.
-Yeah.
-That is the really positive way
to think about it
is that Elvis faked his death,
and he's back,
and he's living a weird,
weird life.
-Yeah.
-That's the Elvis you are now.

name:John Oliver

text:-It's weirder
than Vegas Elvis, yeah.
-So that is the perfect --
that is the perfect
distillation, I think,
of optimism and negativity.
Negativity is,
"Elvis is dead now.
He died,
and he's dead forever."

name:John Oliver

text:Optimism is,
"Elvis never died,
and he's about
to make a comeback album
louder than ever before."
[ Laughter ]
-And it'll be, like,
"Is it the classics?"
It's like, "No, it's crazy
new stuff that you..."
-That's right.
He's into drum --

name:John Oliver

text:-That's the balance is like,
"He's alive."
That's the good news.
The bad news is,
it's crazier than ever.
-He's like Sting.
He's really into lute music now.
[ Laughter ]
-He's doing a live lute concert.
-That's right.

name:John Oliver

text:And he's doing drum and bass.
He really likes drum and bass.
-Oh, good.
That's what Elvis needed.
I do want to ask --
I forgot to ask this earlier,
because Beyoncé is also
in the "Lion King" film.
-Whoo!
-Yes. That's right.
[ Cheers and applause ]
That's --

name:John Oliver

text:That is the appropriate response
to the word "Beyoncé."
-Yeah.
-And that's real-life royalty,
Beyoncé.
-Oh, gotcha.
So, have you met her?
-I would drop
to my [bleep] knees.
-Oh, you would.
-Yeah.

name:John Oliver

text:[ Cheers and applause ]
Don't.
Please.
Don't look at me, Queen.
Don't look at me, Queen!
-It is really --
She's a very hard person --
-Have you met her?

name:John Oliver

text:-Like, only in those very brief
"SNL" sort of, like,
passing moments.
-That counts.
-It counts,
but it renders you wordless.
-Did she say hello to you?
-Yes.
-You met her!
-Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

name:John Oliver

text:-I don't --
I don't care that you're sick.
-All this stuff.
These were here.
-Two years ago, at the Emmys,
I was supposed
to be sitting behind her,
and she didn't turn up.
And my only plan
for the whole Emmys

name:John Oliver

text:was to watch
the back of her head
and witness her interacting with
her immediate surroundings.
-Yeah. With all due respect to
whoever is hosting the Emmys,
nothing -- no one
has ever done it better
than the back of Beyoncé's head.
-That's right.
[ Laughter ]

name:John Oliver

text:But, yeah, she's in
the "Lion King," as well,
and I am absolutely sure
that I will not
be allowed to meet her,
especially after this interview.
-No.
-This feels like something
her security team
should be made aware of
in some way.

name:John Oliver

text:"He seems a little highly strung
when her name comes up."
-Your show's on a holiday break,
but Catheter Cowboy
is gonna be in action.
For those who don't know,
you want to give a quick
description of Catheter Cowboy?
-Yeah, it's quite hard
to explain.

name:John Oliver

text:But, basically, there is
a Catheter Cowboy on Fox News,
and Fox News is obviously where
our current president
gets lots of information,
which is both fact and sad.
And so to try
and sneak information to him,
we've been taking out ads
on Fox News
with our own Catheter Cowboy,

name:John Oliver

text:trying to explain to him things
like what the Nuclear Triad is.
-Yeah.
-And so he will be --
While we're away,
he will be appearing
sporadically on Fox News,
trying to get information
into his unyielding head.
-And so these are ads that
you've shot and time bought.

name:John Oliver

text:-That's right.
They will be --
They will be getting rolled out
until they are stopped.
[ Laughter ]
-Well, it's always
very difficult times
when you guys are on a break.
I hope you can rest,

name:John Oliver

text:although I know you guys
rarely do.
But it shows up
in the work you do,
and I'm just so happy
to have you here.
Brazil home of that one famous statue
that I don't know the name of because
I'm too embarrassed to Google come at me

name:John Oliver

text:bro Jesus statue we we tend to think of
Brazil as being synonymous with soccer
beaches and of course the Rio Carnival
the exuberant celebration that has
inspired breathless newsreel reports
since the 1930s down in Rio they're

name:John Oliver

text:turning night into day it's the final
day of the big carnival and a mere
couple of million karaokes Brazilians -
you are out on a great whoopi yes those
fan seeking Carioca at having themselves
a great whoopie what an excitable group

name:John Oliver

text:of people they are what a fun punch now
I will be the first with me it's the
tone of British news newsreels in the
past he's breathtakingly condescending
although before you get too judgmental
you might want to see an American one

name:John Oliver

text:from the same era Brazil itself is
larger than the whole of the United
States and it has millions of acres of
land that no white man has ever seen
oh that basic geography lesson just took
a pretty racist turn the point is none

name:John Oliver

text:of us have our hands clean anyway the
reason the reason that I want to talk
about Brazil tonight is that they had a
massive election today the first of two
rounds of voting to elect among other
things a new president and what results

name:John Oliver

text:are coming in as we speak it is worth
talking about it for a number of reasons
first a Brazilian politics can be a lot
of fun as we've mentioned before
broadcasters have to provide free
airtime to political parties and some

name:John Oliver

text:candidates use that airtime to really
 around over the years they've been
ads for a guy dressed as a grasshopper a
dancing chicken a small elderly version
of Robin a surprisingly healthy-looking
asama bin Laden

name:John Oliver

text:Captain America a husky spider-man and
my favorite Geraldo Wolverine
now I know what you're thinking if
Hillary adjust on that things would have
been a lot different well maybe maybe
maybe but the point we'll never know

name:John Oliver

text:will we
we'll never know this election has been
crazy for reasons that go well beyond
novelty Wolverines and if you're
thinking why should I care about it well
first that's a pretty hostile way to put

name:John Oliver

text:it but second Brazil is home to 200
million people it's the fifth largest
country on Earth and they could be on
the brink of massive change but his
Brazilians are pissed off right now one
recent survey found that 95% of them say

name:John Oliver

text:their countries headed in the wrong
direction as you will see tonight there
is a very real chance that they're about
to elect a dangerous ideologue with
potentially disastrous consequences so
let us look at why that is the case and

name:John Oliver

text:the first thing that you really need to
understand is that Brazil is just
emerging from the worst recession in its
history millions are out of work and in
some regions crime is out of control
last year there were more than 63,000

name:John Oliver

text:homicides in Brazil that's more than
Europe and the United States combined
and if you live in Rio
you're probably acutely aware of that
fact turreted percent of the citizen
that lives the real was in a middle of a

name:John Oliver

text:crossfire once in the last year 30% were
in the middle of crossfire at that point
Rio's Weather Channel should probably
include crossfire in their forecasts
today's looking partly cloudy with a 30
percent charge about hailstorm of

name:John Oliver

text:bullets so maybe bring a light flak
jacket with you and the general
dissatisfaction about crime has been
exacerbated by a gigantic corruption
scandal arising from the investigation
known as Operation car wash and I

name:John Oliver

text:realize that that doesn't sound like the
name of a major investigation it sounds
like a Netflix original comedy starring
Kevin James that for some reason you'll
be recommended because you watched one
episode of chef's table I don't know I

name:John Oliver

text:don't know what your algorithm is
Netflix but I hate it
now now operation carwash and the
scandal uncovered by it is way too
complicated to get into now suffice to
say that it involves this gas station

name:John Oliver

text:these two companies inflated contracts
bribes and kickbacks to government
officials and an elderly gentleman who
flew around the world with bricks of
cash shrink-wrapped
and straps beneath thigh-high socks and

name:John Oliver

text:a Spanx like vest which really explains
this year's hottest Halloween costume
sexy carwash co-conspirator and look the
sheer scale of this scandal is
absolutely mind-blowing as the elite
prosecutor will tell you how does

name:John Oliver

text:carwash compare to Watergate carwash is
much much bigger bigger than Watergate
much bigger we already have charged more
than two hundred people for hundreds of
crimes the amounts of bribes paid go up
to about two billion dollars billion

name:John Oliver

text:dollars and bigger than Watergate
Richard Nixon must be spinning in his
grave right now oh wait a second pull
out a bit no he's escaped again he's
done it again god damn it tricky dick
you're so tricky yes so tricky

name:John Oliver

text:operated carwash has rocked Brazilians
faith in their government to its very
core and the people there are
understandably disillusioned I think
Brazil is heading towards complete chaos
that is my impression politicians are

name:John Oliver

text:not governing it's a complete mess I'm
going to cast a blank ballot because we
don't know who to vote for anymore we
put ourselves in this situation the
country of the future is the country of
misery the country of misery that's just

name:John Oliver

text:not a phrase you expect to come out of
Brazil
it's afraid to expect to be the official
tourism slogan of Great Britain come to
read me we promise there will be no
great whoopee so whose job will it be to

name:John Oliver

text:try and turn things around in Brazil
well the most popular politician in
Brazil by far is this guy former
President Luiz inácio Lula da Silva he's
beloved for presiding over a period of
prosperity there in which social

name:John Oliver

text:programs were expanded and millions were
lifted out of poverty he was actually
running to retake his office and was
projected to win easily there was just
one
issue one of brazil's most influential

name:John Oliver

text:political figures is now in police
custody former Brazilian President Luiz
Lula da Silva turned himself in on
Saturday to serve a 12 year sentence for
corruption yep Lula was caught up in
operation car wash - and he claims that

name:John Oliver

text:the charges against him were politically
motivated and many supporters believe
him in fact he's still so popular the
polls showed he would have won the
election if he'd been allowed to run
from prison which kind of makes sense

name:John Oliver

text:because electing a president who is
already in prison for corruption does
save you this seemingly inevitable
hassle of having to put your president
in prison for corruption it's a time
saver if nothing else

name:John Oliver

text:now since Lula is out his party is
running Fernando Haddad in his place
he's the former mayor of Sao Paulo and
he's generally little known him in the
rest of Brazil and instead of trying to
build up a brand of his own daddys

name:John Oliver

text:desperately trying to play up his
similarity to Lula in a series of
campaign ads it's subtle but just see if
you can catch it that is just an insult
to people's intelligence you can't just
spin a sign and make people forget which

name:John Oliver

text:guy is which I can't make you mix up
Gary Busey and Lucille Ball by spinning
a sign and going goosey loosey goosey
loosey goosey loosey goosey loosey
goosey loosey why because you will still
know which one is America's Sweetheart

name:John Oliver

text:and which was married to Desi Arnaz now
the fact is the fact is a dad has his
work cut out for him here because not
only is he not Lula their party the
Workers Party or PT has been heavily
tainted by recent scandals and many

name:John Oliver

text:Brazilians are eager for a radical
change and that brings us to the man
currently leading in the polls
Jaya volson ro and the nicest thing that
you can say for him is he has not been
implicated in a corruption investigation

name:John Oliver

text:yet unfortunately that's literally the
only nice thing that I can possibly find
to say about him because he is a
terrible human being for a start he's a
big fan of doing finger guns
seriously he does this all the

name:John Oliver

text:time there is even video of him teaching
a little girl how to do them for some
reason
and look liking finger guns as far as
I'm concerned is an immediate character
flaw it puts him in the August company

name:John Oliver

text:of Michael Scott's children pretending
to be Cowboys and that co-worker who
says things like working hard or hardly
working that everybody hates
unfortunately it only gets worse from
there a member of the Brazilian Congress

name:John Oliver

text:since 1991 and known for his sometimes
racist misogynistic homophobic and even
undemocratic views bolson arrow has
passed himself as a political outsider
offensive for most it is his outspoken
nature that has many saying he's

name:John Oliver

text:Brazil's version of Donald Trump it's
true he's become known there as the
Brazilian Trump which is both
politically worrisome and also the
grossest style to order and a pubic hair
salon I'll take the up Brazilian Trump

text:please it's what you rip everything off
the front area but you come some ass
hair around to give the illusion of hair
that's what it is I'm not showing you
that you're imagining it that's in your
head don't be angry with me be angry

name:John Oliver

text:with yourself
now unfortunately boss Nara has fired up
many young people in Brazil particularly
from the middle and upper classes there
are some incredible videos online of him
turning up to airports only to be mobbed

name:John Oliver

text:by a crowd lifting him onto their
shoulders and chanting for him it is
some intense support and it's worrying
that young people are so excited by him
because he is an extreme hard right
conservative he wants to withdraw Brazil

name:John Oliver

text:from the Paris agreement on climate
change and weaken environmental
regulations
he's called refugees arriving in Brazil
the scum of the world and as for crime
he wants to make it easier for

name:John Oliver

text:Brazilians to buy guns presumably so
they can fight it themselves but he also
favors some psychotically strong law
enforcement saying a policeman who
doesn't kill isn't a policeman which
incredibly still isn't even in the top

name:John Oliver

text:10 most alarming statements that he's
made and some way that he'd actually go
much further
Boston aura has said in the past I am in
favor of a dictatorship which is
particularly worried

name:John Oliver

text:as he's a former military captain in a
country that until 1985 was ruled by a
brutal military dictatorship and while
that regime engaged in torture and
extrajudicial killings balsa Morrow has
said that that mistake was that they

name:John Oliver

text:simply didn't go far enough I'm in favor
of torture you know that and the people
are too through the vote you won't
change anything in this country nothing
absolutely nothing it's only going to
change unfortunately when we get to a

name:John Oliver

text:civil war doing the job that the
military regime didn't do killing 30,000
Wow
he's pretty jarring to hear someone
claim that a military dictatorship
didn't kill enough people he's like

name:John Oliver

text:saying Hugh Hefner didn't enough in
the last days of his life really really
because I'm pretty sure the amount he
did it was already a human rights abuse
and regarding Boston arrows famous
homophobia and misogyny it really has to

name:John Oliver

text:be seen to be believed
first take a look at how he won't spoke
to a female member of Congress I would
never rape you because you're not worth
it I hope not because I'd slap you in
the face do it I'll slap you back do it

name:John Oliver

text:I'll slap you back do it I'll slap you
back what's this are you pushing me do
it I'll slap you back holy he
starts he starts there with I'd never
rape you because you're not worth it and
then somehow manages to top that

name:John Oliver

text:terrible statement
that's like saying sorry kids Christmas
is canceled this year why because I've
murdered Santa Claus and both stars
homophobia if any if anything is
actually even worse because in interview

name:John Oliver

text:after interview he has said some more
horrifying things he cackles they throw
6 fresco they want to reach our children
in order to turn the children into gay
adults to satisfy their sexuality in the
future if your child starts to become

name:John Oliver

text:like that a little gay you take a whip
and you change their behavior people say
it's discrimination but you who's
watching from home would you hire a gay
driver to take your children to school
of course not

name:John Oliver

text:that's just appalling and it's frankly
taking all the restraint that I have
right now not to release a charmingly
Illustrated children's book called
Marlon bando punches that guy right
square in the face

name:John Oliver

text:which is already very comfortably is
watch what happened when Ellen Page went
to challenge Bolton ro on some of his
views I'm gay so do you think that I
should have been beaten as a child
should not be gay now I'm not going to

name:John Oliver

text:look at you and say I think you're gay
that doesn't matter to me you're very
nice if I were a cadet in the Military
Academy and saw you on the street I
would whistle at you all right you're
very pretty

name:John Oliver

text:what are you doing he just told her I
wouldn't beat you I would cat call you
and seemed to genuinely think that was a
compliment
and look how confused that made Ellen
Page do you know how hard it is to

name:John Oliver

text:confuse Ellen Page she was in Inception
that should be simply as if Polaris Camp
Patton was not already dramatic enough
you may have heard he was actually
stabbed a few weeks ago during a
campaign rally which is absolutely

name:John Oliver

text:horrific although although he says that
he's making a full recovery and you can
tell that he is feeling better because
when he was in hospital he pulled out
what else the finger guns
now Bob's our support has actually

name:John Oliver

text:increased since that attack even Geraldo
Wolverine endorsed him in this bizarre
video
ah I hate what he's doing I love the way
he's doing it yeah look why is Wolverine
endorsing Boston ro I don't know why

name:John Oliver

text:does he seem to be driving a Ford Focus
that quest there's a lot of questions of
that video raises and I just don't have
the answers to any of them well look
there may be some small reason for hope
here a huge movement has emerged in the

name:John Oliver

text:last couple of weeks called Ln yow or
not him there have been massive marches
against Boston ro all over Brazil and as
you have seen tonight voting for not him
is a truly excellent idea now today's
election was supposed to just determine

name:John Oliver

text:who went into a two-person runoff on
October 28th but if any candidate got
fifty percent or above there would be no
second round they would just be Brazil's
president and as of right now the vote
tally shows Bolton ro and around 48

name:John Oliver

text:percent with over three-quarters of the
votes counted so while he will probably
go to a runoff with her dad there is
still a chance that he's going to win
outright tonight and when you think
about it why wouldn't that happen

name:John Oliver

text:between taping this show and airtime
boston ro could have won Ruth Bader
Ginsburg could have been eaten by a bear
and every kitten spores could have been
replaced by octopus tentacles
oh that's very possible because it seems

name:John Oliver

text:that that's what life is now but
if bolton ro has not won if there is
going to be a runoff in three weeks then
it still it isn't too late that's the
thing and Brazil please look I realize
that you are disgusted with your

name:John Oliver

text:politics in the moment and you're not
inspired by any of the alternatives but
anything is better than Boston ro diet
Lula is better
spider-man is better Gary Busey is
better that is Gary Busey I'm pretty

name:John Oliver

text:sure that's him the point is Boston ro
does not reflect the best of who you are
Brazil and with any luck you still have
a chance to vote la now and not let this
man finger bang your democracy
you

name:John Oliver

text:you
thank you so much for talking to Sky
News you're welcome Scott use a new
series coming out but there's a whole
lot of stuff that's happened since
you've been off air so what you're gonna

name:John Oliver

text:tackle first I don't know I don't know
we'll see because you know we're still
as we speak we're still two weeks away
from the show happening so a lot can
happen in two weeks nowadays it used to
be very little could happen in two weeks

name:John Oliver

text:now almost anything can happen up to and
including there no longer being an
America in which I can do my show
there's an on it's at close to zero but
a nonzero chance that this country is
just ashen planks or you have said that

name:John Oliver

text:there's a nonzero chance of you being
deported does that threat still exists
oh you know it's close to zero there is
a chance there is a chance I could be
removed do you really believe that
oh yes sadly yeah I mean I shouldn't

name:John Oliver

text:because I haven't done anything wrong
and you know I am I am protected due to
the you know the very helpful pesky
nosov the US Constitution and the First
Amendment really does defend my right to
talk the way that I do here and you

name:John Oliver

text:pwned the ability I hope yeah yeah well
it's you know that's the it's one of the
best things about this country it's that
you can say what you want and you know
people can use that gift well or badly
do you get threats or you know does the

name:John Oliver

text:White House call you up and say stop
being me about the president I mean what
I mean know that what if if the White
House called us up I'm not that would be
a real problem
I don't think we're really on their

name:John Oliver

text:radar or if we do it's more like you
know we have the irritant of a mosquito
I think yeah I don't
I doubt what they pay much attention to
what we're doing so yeah they don't
really complain again they have nothing

name:John Oliver

text:to complain about because when we say
they're lying it's because they just
lied about something that's not opinion
that's a fact best offensive if we got
something wrong we would get sued and we
go off the air which is why we don't get

name:John Oliver

text:things wrong so yeah we have to get
that's why we have to research things so
rigorously because when you take big
swings it's like they say in the wire
right you come at the King you best not
miss

name:John Oliver

text:and so that is the that's the problem
like when you do shows about major
American corporations you have to be
right otherwise they will crush you like
a bug
talking about trust and the public you

name:John Oliver

text:know having faith in journalism and
commentary they don't appear to have
very much at the moment Trust trust is
declining in journalism in particular
what do you think newsrooms and
journalists can do about that

name:John Oliver

text:that is a confounding ly difficult
question sorry
just because it's hard to know quite
where to begin there like whether you go
to the original sin of where that trust
was lost or whether you try and and also

name:John Oliver

text:you don't want to kind of cosign too
much on trust being fretted away in the
news especially in this country just
because this administration is battering
on about it being faking and obviously
nonsensical vain so I think the best

name:John Oliver

text:thing but news in general in all its
various forms can do it's just like
rigorous due diligence at making sure
that you can't ring-fence
the ground that you're standing on I
think in the world one of the most

name:John Oliver

text:dangerous things we're seeing is people
but passing on information and I think
both the news and as individuals that
probably needs to be a heightened
responsibility to not pass things on as
facts if you're not sure that they are

name:John Oliver

text:facts so we've had an idea about how to
celebrate transparency oh yeah live
cameras I heard about that that is like
if if you get ready to bleep this out a
terrible idea are you gonna set anything
up here you're not just gonna put you

name:John Oliver

text:there clearly there's warning signs
right because people who work in
business swear a lot yeah right you say
a lot of been asked not to it's also a
delay do your job and a bleep a button I
think wow that bleep a button I'd better

name:John Oliver

text:have fresh batteries replaced a lot 24
hours of square
ringing the sky news office I listen I
hate the idea but I am looking forward
to watching it are we gonna appear on
your show

name:John Oliver

text:I mean inevitably because I just can't
imagine that going smoothly whose desk
is it going to be near you're gonna get
to choose the shots there's multiple
live camera it's an awful idea
I hate it i it's the worst 30th birthday

name:John Oliver

text:present I've ever heard of and on that
note thank you John
we're talking to Sky News
this has been a big week for the LGBT
community but it's also been a big year
for the T part of that equation from

name:John Oliver

text:Caitlyn Jenner's Vanity Fair cover two
TV shows like transparent to another
small milestone just this Friday with
the curtain Tussauds San Francisco now
that is a big step forward for
transgender Americans and it's frankly

name:John Oliver

text:about time because bear in mind it came
after the same milestone for Spyder
Americans and wookiees but but for all
the strides transgender people have made
lately let's not get too complacent
about how far we've come because they

name:John Oliver

text:still face a host of obstacles even when
the news media are trying to be
supportive they can make dumb mistakes
your private parts are different now
aren't they I don't want to talk about
it because it's it's so it's really

name:John Oliver

text:personal don't you feel funny with the
wrong genitalia not as a joke you stand
up in the women's bathroom you know I
they're tasteful whatever whatever is
going on
thank you so if I saw you undressed you

name:John Oliver

text:would look like a woman to me totally
yes
what are you doing it is no more okay to
ask
transgender people about their sex
organs than it would be to ask Jimmy

name:John Oliver

text:Carter whether or not he's circumcised
which by the way he is smooth like a
boiled carrots and sometimes sometimes
don't think about that and sometimes the
media's confusion is even more basic
than that as in the case of this Arizona

name:John Oliver

text:weatherman just two weeks ago and a
transgender woman says she was kicked
out of a tempe bar let's bring it back
to that earlier headline now as a
transgender woman death
what does that even mean that she used

name:John Oliver

text:to be a guy but now the woman
[Music]
this is are you just saying a woman I
can't even keep up anymore
oh really hope that's also how he
reports the weather wait

name:John Oliver

text:it used to be rainy and now it's sunny
so so so now it's just sunny now I can't
even keep up anymore
[Applause]
look let's let's give him the benefit of
the doubt maybe for him and for many

name:John Oliver

text:people this is new information maybe
he's thinking about transgender issues
for the first time and he needs a minute
to try and understand it so let's take
that minute to fill in that bamboozled
weatherman and everyone else on some

name:John Oliver

text:basic details transgender people have a
gender identity that differs from the
one they were assigned at birth and that
gender identity is not the same as
sexual orientation gender identity is
who you are

name:John Oliver

text:sexual orientation is who you love some
transgender people do undergo hormone
therapy or sex reassignment surgery as
part of their transition some do not and
interestingly their decision on this
matter is medically speaking none of

name:John Oliver

text:your business what do I call a
transgender person it's so confusing
well actually it's pretty simple call
them whatever they want to be called you
can do it we do it all the time think of
it this way David Evans woke up one day

name:John Oliver

text:and said everyone call me the edge and
we all went find the edge are we talking
from now on or the verb and and that's
it's not just that it's not just that
over the past 20 years we've agreed to
call this man Puff Daddy P Diddy just

name:John Oliver

text:Diddy
and now Puff Daddy again and most people
don't even like him
[Applause]
it's genuinely crucial that we get this
right because there are more transgender

name:John Oliver

text:people in the u.s. than you might
realize one study estimates that nearly
700,000 American adults are transgender
that's more than the population of
Boston and you probably know someone
from Boston I'll give you a clue it was

name:John Oliver

text:the guy who wore a Bruins jersey to your
sister's wedding Wow while a handful of
transgender people have been winning
awards or appearing on magazine covers
the community at large has been facing
some staggering challenges a 2011 survey

name:John Oliver

text:by the National Center for transgender
equality found 41% of transgender people
had attempted suicide they are nearly 4
times more likely to make less than $100
a year compared to the general
population 78 percent of those surveyed

name:John Oliver

text:reported harassment during K through 12
school 35% reported physical assault and
12% were sexually assaulted that is
terrible
those statistics are so depressing it's
enough to make you angry at the very

name:John Oliver

text:concept of numbers Q symbols meant to
represent a specific value you're the
absolute worst the worst we've we
clearly got work to do because when
you're transgender pretty much any
interaction with bureaucracy can be

name:John Oliver

text:humiliatingly difficult just take what
happened to two transgender women when
they went to the DMV in West Virginia
both women were asked to remove all
their jewelry makeup and wigs before the
DMV would photograph them they're saying

name:John Oliver

text:that I need to fulfill certain certain
look that they are designating means
male and that I'm yeah hiding Who I am
which I'm absolutely not both women say
they will also refer to as it listen I'm
not saying anyone has a good DMV

name:John Oliver

text:experience but that is the worst I have
ever heard and for the record you get to
pick virtually everything else on your
driver's license they ask you your
weight they don't weight you like a
prize hog

name:John Oliver

text:plus the whole idea of a driver's
license photo is to present how you look
from day to day
that's why DMV employees tell you not to
smile because they can't imagine anyone
whose normal existence involves

name:John Oliver

text:happiness in any form and anything is
even in organizations that have seemed
willing to change that change has come
frustratingly slowly take the military
both the Secretary of Defense and
President Obama have indicated they are

name:John Oliver

text:open to transgender troops being able to
serve and yet they're still banned from
enlisting because of weirdly archaic
restrictions on things like defects of
the genitalia such as change of sex and
psychosexual conditions including but

name:John Oliver

text:not limited to transsexualism and
transvestitism our current recruitment
poster is essentially I want you maybe
after we talk about your genitals for a
bit I know that's weird but for the
moment this is apparently how we do

name:John Oliver

text:things and yet even despite those
restrictions on enlistment by one
estimate there are currently 15,000
transgender service members and what you
can be discharged for being transgender
those rules are enforced inconsistently

name:John Oliver

text:depending on your branch of service and
commanding officer
meaning experiences can vary wildly but
for some like Logan Ireland it could be
great what I like about this deployment
is I can be my authentic self

name:John Oliver

text:I'm just another guy whereas back home
I'm still seen as female and I go by
FEMA regs and standards here in
Afghanistan a war zone it's like a
vacation to me because I can be myself
in such an austere environment it is not

name:John Oliver

text:a great sign for how we treat
transgender people that Afghanistan is a
place where you can be yourself
that is the least likely tourism slogan
for Afghanistan I put it right behind
water park capital of the world and

name:John Oliver

text:birthplace of the twerk but but compare
that with the experience of captain
Jacob eliazar of the Army National Guard
who faced discharge for being
transgender despite his own command to
support and the fact he was being

name:John Oliver

text:awarded a medal the thing that stuck
with me the most is as they were pinning
that that army commendation medal I mean
my regimental commander said thank you
for everything that you've done for our
regiment Jacob and you use my real name

name:John Oliver

text:and I I can't I can't express just the
emotion of that juxtaposition it's like
you're you're kicking me out but you're
acknowledging me for myself and giving
you award at the same time that utterly
ridiculous they gave him an award and

name:John Oliver

text:then tried to kick him out it's pretty
much what Hollywood did to Cuba Gooding
jr. and that wasn't okay either but but
this is the big problem these are the
big problem because even when people say
the right things about the transgender

name:John Oliver

text:community too often practical change
fails to follow and perhaps the perfect
embodiment of this concerns bathrooms we
all use them as the good book tells us
everyone poops or as it's known in
England everyone poops but to the Queen

name:John Oliver

text:she has people do it for her across the
country there have been efforts by
lawmakers to fight non-discrimination
ordinances with so-called bathroom bills
like this one in Arizona it's a new show
me your papers bill for Arizona the sex

name:John Oliver

text:on your birth certificate would have to
match the sex of the bathroom or locker
room that you use the target transgender
men
women here in Arizona six months in jail
$2,500 fine for just going into P $2,500

name:John Oliver

text:fine for peeing in the wrong place look
unless you happen to urinate a 1989
Chateau pur true you're not even going
to break even on that deal in the most
recent session at least 13 bathroom
bills have been introduced in state

name:John Oliver

text:legislatures and the reasoning behind
them can be pretty insulting just listen
to presidential candidate Mike Huckabee
here now in City after City watching
ordinances that say that your
seven-year-old daughter if she goes into

name:John Oliver

text:the restroom cannot be offended and you
can't be offended if she's greeted there
by a 42 year old man who feels more like
a woman than he does a man now I wish
someone had told me when I was in high
school that I could have felt like a

name:John Oliver

text:woman when it came time to take showers
and PE I'm pretty sure I would have
found my feminine side and said coach I
think I'd rather shower with the girls
today you're laughing because it sounds
so ridiculous doesn't it there's

name:John Oliver

text:something inherently wrong with forcing
little children to be a part of this
social experiment no but there is
something inherently wrong with forcing
us to listen to your up daydreams
about all the sex you just being able to

name:John Oliver

text:find a legal
that's weird that kind of baseless
fear-mongering is everywhere it even
turned up in a campaign ad when
Gainesville Florida was trying to pass
one of these bills

name:John Oliver

text:[Music]
[Applause]
ok let's let's break that down
because first assaulting children is
still illegal secondly someone abusing a
non-discrimination ordinance to assault

name:John Oliver

text:someone in a bathroom is almost unheard
of it's a borderline imaginary crime
like dragon rustling or space best
eality sure it's terrible but it doesn't
really happen also forcing transgender
people into certain bathrooms can

name:John Oliver

text:actually be much more disruptive as
activists Michael Hughes a transgender
man showed with this photo of himself
looking understandably awkward in a
ladies room because there are many
places that Michael would fit in a

name:John Oliver

text:tattoo parlor in Reno playing steel
guitar in a Johnny Cash tribute band or
on the label of his own barbecue sauce
but a woman's bathroom
not so much besides it is so much easier
for everyone when people are allowed to

name:John Oliver

text:use the bathroom that matches their
gender identity rather than one that
might match the genitalia they were born
with that is why the little pictures on
bathroom doors are stereotypical
representations of men and women and not

name:John Oliver

text:biologically accurate depictions of
penises and vaginas because that would
be troubling for children
so I go with the one with the party slug
or the angry goat skull on stairs yes
legislators have even tried to enforce

name:John Oliver

text:these bills in high schools with
damaging consequences take the case of
Henry Bruce Oh a transgender high school
student who spoke in opposition to a
proposed bathroom bill in Kentucky even
though I've been living as a male for

name:John Oliver

text:some time I've been been accepted by my
friends and family at Smail I was being
forced to use the girls bathroom and my
school to very recently because the
school administration did not support my
gender either than by letting me use the

name:John Oliver

text:restrooms Concordat with my gender
identity the kids on my school bully me
the kids thought that because his
administrative administration didn't
support my gender identity they didn't
have to either and that is the whole

name:John Oliver

text:point official rules can end up
legitimizing prejudice and besides
teenagers really don't need extra ideas
for how to make each other's lives
miserable that's what they do sit on
your own

name:John Oliver

text:Becca side ponytails are so five Nevers
ago as Henry finished his speech it
actually seems like he'd really
connected with the legislators if you
don't know a transgender kid already you
do know you do now you know me Henry

name:John Oliver

text:please let me know how I can be any
further assistance and thank you so much
for your time today and please vote no
on Senate bill 76 I educated myself a
lot today and I appreciate the testimony
you should be proud of proud of yourself

name:John Oliver

text:for being outstanding from this
committee and be so articulate in your
comments Henry I love you man I
appreciate you I appreciate your courage
I can't really imagine that anyone else
in this room has the kind of courage

name:John Oliver

text:that it took for you to come and testify
today okay okay but I love you man it's
a little much I love Henry too but he's
not the best man at your wedding he's a
teenage boy trying to take a in the
men's room

name:John Oliver

text:and and it's worth noting once they were
done patting Henry on the back and then
patting themselves for patting Henry all
three of those lawmakers voted to
advance the bill to force him into
bathrooms where he's bullied now

name:John Oliver

text:thankfully that that particular bill
never became law but that dynamic of
praising a transgender persons courage
and then not actually supporting them
speaks to the fact that we are weirdly
comfortable celebrating transgender

name:John Oliver

text:people while simultaneously dehumanizing
them at the DMV printing awards to them
as we drum them out of the military and
constantly quizzing them about their
genitals and look this is a civil rights
issue and if you are not willing to

name:John Oliver

text:support transgender people for their
sake at least do it for your own because
we've been through this before we know
how this thing ends if you take the anti
civil rights side and deny people access
to something they're entitled to history

name:John Oliver

JAPANESE NEWS OR AS THEY CALL IT
IN JAPAN, THE NEWS, OHE JAPANESE
REST ROOM INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION
HAS DESIGNED A NEW STANDARDIZED
CONTROL PANEL FOR TOILETS
BECAUSE FOREN TOURISTS FIND
THEIR TOILET TOOS CONFUSING.
AND I'M LIKE WHO'S WALKING TOO A
BATHROOM LOOKING AT A TOILET AND
THINKING OKAY, WHAT DO I DO
HERE?

name:James Cordan

text:(LAUGHTER)
NOW APPARENTLY THE CONFUSION
COMES FROM JAPANESE TOILETS
HAVING A LOT OF BUTTONS AND
EXTRA FEATURES.
AND THIS TRUE, TOURISTS WERE
ACCIDENTALLY PUSHING AN ALARM
BUTTON THAT IS COMMON OVER
THERE.
AND MY QUESTION IS, WHAT ARE THE
JAPANESE EATING.

name:James Cordan

text:I'VE DONE SOME ALARMING THINGS
ON THE TOILET BUT I HAVE NEVER
HAD TO HIT AN ACTUAL ALARM.
LIKE HOW COMPLICATED COULD THIS
BE?
LIKE I BETTED I COULD FIGURE OUT
WHAT THESE BUTTONS MEAN.
LETS' TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE
BUTTONS. SO THERE IS IS THIS

NAME.

text:AND FINALLY, FINALLY FINALLY
THIS ONE IS FOR WHEN YOUR WASTE
COMES OUT IN PERFECT CUBES.
THANKS, GUYS, THAT IS OUR SHOW.
GOOD NIGHT. WE'LL SEE YOU.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE NEWS.
IT WAS REVEALED YESTERDAY
THAT THE F.B.I. IS NOW

name:James Cordan

text:INVESTIGATING PRESIDENT
DONALD TRUMP FOR OBSTRUCTION
OF JUSTICE.
NOW, I DON'T KNOW IF TRUMP
OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE, BUT I'LL
TELL YOU WHAT HE HAS
OBSTRUCTED: MY ABILITY TO
TALK ABOUT ANYTHING OTHER
THAN TRUMP EVERY NIGHT ON
THIS SHOW.

name:James Cordan

text:AND LET'S BE HONEST, THAT'S
THE REAL CRIME!
ISN'T IT?
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHETHER
OR NOT BEYONCE'S TWINS HAVE
ARRIVED.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
WHERE ARE THEY?

name:James Cordan

text:BUT I GUESS THIS
INVESTIGATION IS ALSO A BIG
DEAL.
DEMOCRATS ARE HOPING THAT THIS
WILL LEAD TO IMPEACHMENT
REPUBLICANS, ON THE OTHER
HAND, ARE SECRETLY HOPING
THIS LEADS TO IMPEACHMENT.
NOW, HOW DO YOU GUYS THINK
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

name:James Cordan

text:STATES RESPONDED TO THESE
VERY SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS?
IF YOU GUESSED, ON
TWITTER, I'M SORRY TO REPORT
THAT YOU WERE CORRECT.
BECAUSE THIS MORNING, DONALD
TRUMP TWEETED:
"THEY MADE UP A PHONY
COLLUSION WITH THE RUSSIAN
STORY, FOUND ZERO PROOF, SO
NOW THEY GO WITH OBSTRUCTION

name:James Cordan

text:OF JUSTICE ON THE PHONY
STORY.
NICE!"
I HAVE TO SAY, DONALD TRUMP
IS THE FIRST PRESIDENT TO
MAKE REGULAR USE OF THE
SARCASTIC "NICE."
ISN'T HE?
YOU NEVER HEARD F.D.R. GO
"THIS IS A DATE WHICH WILL

name:James Cordan

text:LIVE IN INFAMY.
NICE!"
(LAUGHTER)
WELL, ACTUALLY, BILL CLINTON
DID USE "NICE," BUT IT WAS
DIFFERENT.
IT WAS WHEN HE SAID, "I DID
NOT HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONS
WITH THAT WOMAN --
NICE!"

name:James Cordan

text:(LAUGHTER)
TRUMP ALSO TRIED TO DEFLECT
THE ALLEGATIONS BY GOING
AFTER HILLARY CLINTON.
AGAIN.
THIS AFTERNOON, HE POSTED:
"CROOKED H DESTROYED PHONES
WITH HAMMER, BLEACHED
E-MAILS AND HAD HUSBAND MEET
WITH AG DAYS BEFORE SHE WAS
CLEARED-- AND THEY TALK

name:James Cordan

text:ABOUT OBSTRUCTION?"
NOW JUST SO YOU KNOW, I
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS
MEANS EITHER.
BUT LET'S GO THROUGH IT
PIECE BY PIECE.
LET'S START WITH CROOKED H.
NOW, I THINK HE'S TALKING ABOUT
HILLARY, BUT CROOKED H COULD
ALSO BE A MEMBER OF THE WU
TANG CLAN.

name:James Cordan

text:"CROOKED H" SOUNDS LIKE HOW
SOMEONE WOULD DESCRIBE THE
LETTER "K" IF THEY FORGOT
WHAT IT WAS CALLED.
YOU KNOW, WHAT'S THE LETTER, THE
CROOKED H, YOU KNOW THE ONE.
K, THAT'S RIGHT.
NEXT, HE SAID SHE BLEACHED
HER E-MAILS.
COME ON, THAT DOESN'T SOUND
SO BAD.

name:James Cordan

text:DOES IT?
SOMETIMES, BEFORE A REALLY
HOT DATE NIGHT WITH MY WIFE
I'LL GO GET MY E-MAIL
BLEACHED.
WHAT?
IT'S A COURTESY TO YOUR
PARTNER.
ALL KIDDING ASIDE, GUYS.

name:James Cordan

text:THEN HE SAYS HILLARY, "HAD
HUSBAND MEET WITH AG DAYS
TELLING YOU EXACTLY HOW OVER HER
HE IS.
BUT HE REALLY IS OBSESSED WITH
HER.
HE ALSO TWEETED,
HE ALSO TWEETED: "WHY IS
THAT HILLARY CLINTON'S
FAMILY AND DEMS DEALINGS
WITH RUSSIA ARE NOT LOOKED
AT, BUT MY NON-DEALINGS

name:James Cordan

text:ARE?"
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION, AND I
THINK I CAN ANSWER THIS ONE,
MR. PRESIDENT.
IT'S BECAUSE SHE'S A GRANDMA
LIVING IN NEW YORK AND YOU
ARE THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES.
WELL, FOR A FEW MONTHS, AT
LEAST.
NICE!

name:James Cordan

text:GOOD EVENING, EVERYBODY!
YOU ALL LOOK SO HAPPY TO BE
HERE!
SOME MORE THAN OTHERS.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I THINK I KNOW WHY.
IT WAS IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK
THAT TWO BEHAVIORAL SCIENTISTS
AT A RESEARCH INSTITUTE IN THE
NETHERLANDS HAVE CONDUCTED A

name:James Cordan

text:STUDY PROVING THE EXISTENCE OF
THE PHENOMENON WE KNOW AS
"RESTING BITCH FACE."
(LAUGHTER)
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT RESTING
BITCH FACE IS, IT'S WHEN YOUR
FACE FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER
LOOKS LIKE YOU JUST GOT A
PARKING TICKET.
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S SORT OF...

name:James Cordan

text:(LAUGHTER)
THE RESEARCHERS HAVE DISCOVERED
THAT "RESTING BITCH FACE" CAN BE
TRACED TO TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.
IT'S EITHER:
A: SOMETHING IN A PERSON'S FACE
IS RELAYING GREATER-THAN-USUAL
AMOUNTS OF CONTEMPT
OR B: THAT PERSON IS A BITCH.
THAT'S RIGHT, RESTING BITCH
FACE.

name:James Cordan

text:IS REAL, AND MEN DO IT, TOO.
THE DIFFERENCE IS WHEN WOMEN DO
IT, WE SAY IT'S "RESTING BITCH
FACE," AND WHEN MEN DO IT IT'S
JUST EVERY MOVIE POSTER.
LOOK AT BOND, THAT BITCH.
AND ME, LOOK AT THAT!
DOUBLE-O BITCH!

name:James Cordan

text:BUT THERE ARE WAYS TO AVOID
RESTING BITCH FACE.
YOUR RESTING FACE SHOULD BE
HAPPY AND INVITING.
TAKE THIS STOCK PHOTO OF A
RANDOM GUY WE FOUND ON THE
INTERNET:
LOOK HOW NICE THAT GUY LOOKS.
HIS TEETH ARE SHOWING, HIS
CHEEKS ARE RAISED.
HE LOOKS LIKE A FRIEND TO
EVERYONE.

name:James Cordan

text:WE SHOULD ALL TRY TO LOOK MORE
LIKE THAT.
HE'S WHO?
OHHH.
RIGHT.
OKAY.
I'VE GOT TO DO MORE RESEARCH.

name:James Cordan

text:NOW SOMEONE WHOSE FACE HAS COME
UNDER A LOT OF SCRUTINY LATELY
IS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TED
CRUZ.
WRITING IN "PSYCHOLOGY TODAY," A
NEUROLOGIST AT GEORGE WASHINGTON
UNIVERSITY SAID THAT TED CRUZ'S
FACE IS NOTABLY UNSETTLING AND
EXHIBITS ATYPICAL EXPRESSIONS.
I MEAN, COME ON.

name:James Cordan

text:WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE ABOUT THIS
FACE?
(LAUGHTER)
IT'S LIKE A BAD HIGH SCHOOL
YEARBOOK PHOTO WHERE THE
PHOTOGRAPHER WAS LIKE, "CHIN UP
JUST A BIT.
OK, NOW LOOK EXTREMELY
CONSTIPATED.
PERFECT."

name:James Cordan

text:I MEAN, HE LOOKS LIKE A BALLOON
TWO WEEKS AFTER A PARTY.
THE NEUROLOGIST WHO CONDUCTED
THIS STUDY HAS SAID THAT HE'S
NEVER ACTUALLY SEEN A
CONVENTIONAL SMILE OUT OF TED
CRUZ.
TO BE FAIR, THE NEUROLOGIST WHO
DID THIS STUDY WAS BEN CARSON.
I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY
WEIRD LOOKING TO BE THE WEIRD

name:James Cordan

text:LOOKING GUY IN A PRESIDENTIAL
RACE THAT ALSO INCLUDES THIS
FACE.
ACTUALLY, LET'S SEE HOW DONALD
TRUMP DESCRIBED TED CRUZ IN A
RECENT MSNBC INTERVIEW WHERE HE
WAS GIVEN CANDIDATES' NAMES AND
ASKED TO GIVE A ONE-WORD
RESPONSE.
>> TED CRUZ.

name:James Cordan

text:I WAS GOING TO SAY N.S.A.Y,
HE'S NOT REALLY N.S.A.Y.
HE'S BEEN VERY NICE.
HE GOES ON AND OFF.
I'LL SAY NASTY.
>> JAMES: I THINK WHAT WE'VE
JUST LEARNED IS THAT DONALD
DEFINITELY DOESN'T HAVE RESTING
BITCH FACE.

name:James Cordan

text:HE HAS ACTIVE BITCH MOUTH.
A NEW
STUDY CAME OUT THIS WEEK, WHICH
SHOWED THAT THE CITIES OF
PORTLAND AND SEATTLE HAVE THE
HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF SINGLE
WOMEN OVER 40 LIVING WITH CATS.
[LAUGHTER]
LOOK AT THAT.
EXCITING NEWS FOR REGGIE.
LIVING WITH CATS.

name:James Cordan

text:VERY DIFFERENT THING.
YEAH, OH.
SO PORTLAND AND SEATTLE LEAD THE
NATION IN CAT LADIES.
IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT THEY
ALSO LEAD THE NATION IN FROZEN
YOGURT SHOPS, ZUMBA CLASSES, AND
CRYING.
[LAUGHTER]
NOW THIS NAPPING PORTLAND --
HAPPENING IN PORTLAND ACTUALLY
MAKES SENSE.

name:James Cordan

text:I FEEL FOR THESE WOMEN.
WHEN THE CHOICE IS BETWEEN A CAT
AND A GUY WHO WORKS 10 HOURS A
WEEK TRYING TO GET HIS URBAN
GOAT FARM UP-AND-RUNNING, YOU'RE
GOING TO GO WITH THE CAT.
YOU ARE.
IT MAKES SENSE IN SEATTLE AS
WELL.
YOU WOULD OWN A CAT AND BE
SINGLE TOO IF THE MOST ELIGIBLE

name:James Cordan

text:BACHELOR IN YOUR CITY WAS THIS
GUY.
[LAUGHTER]
BUT LET'S LOOK AT THE BRIGHT
SIDE HERE.
A CITY FULL OF SINGLE WOMEN WITH
CATS?
SOUNDS LIKE THE PURR-FECT PLACE
FOR AN ELIGIBLE BACHELOR.
[RIMSHOT]
THANK YOU.

THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THAT'S -- THAT JOKE IS ONE OF
MEOWN.

text:[RIMSHOT]
I'M ON FIRE TONIGHT!
BUT BEING A WOMAN ON YOUR OWN IS
ABOUT TO GET A LOT BETTER
BECAUSE THERE'S A NEW PRODUCT
FOR YOUR SMART PHONE CALLED
"IZ-A-VIBE" THAT TURNS YOUR
SMART PHONE INTO A VIBRATOR.
THAT'S RIGHT.
THERE IS A NEW PLACE TO CHECK
NEXT TIME YOUR PHONE GOES
MISSING.

name:James Cordan

text:DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
HAVE YOU SEEN MY PHONE?
[LAUGHTER]
ALSO, I THINK THE NEW SIGN THAT
YOUR MARRIAGE MAY BE FALLING
APART IS WHEN YOUR WIFE IS
CONSTANTLY ASKING FOR A CHARGER.
JUST A WARNING, LADIES.
IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY
EMBARRASSING WHEN YOU
ACCIDENTALLY DIAL YOUR MOM WHILE

name:James Cordan

text:USING THIS THING.
"SORRY, MOM.
THAT WAS A VAGINA DIAL."
[LAUGHTER]
"SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO.
IT WAS A VAG DIAL."
HERE'S HOW THIS DEVICE
WORKS.
FIRST, YOU DOWNLOAD THE PROGRAM
AND ATTACH THE VIBRATOR TO YOUR

THAT'S WHEN YOU INSERT THE

[TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES]
AND THAT'S WHAT I CALL A HAPPY
HOLIDAY.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET INTO IT.
LET'S GET RIGHT INTO THE
DISASTER THAT IS OUR PRESIDENT

name:James Cordan

text:OF THE UNITED STATES.
(APPLAUSE)
(LAUGHTER)
BECAUSE TODAY DONALD TRUMP
ANNOUNCED ON TWITTER THAT HE
WANTS TO BAN TRANSGENDER
SOLDIERS FROM SERVING IN THE
U.S. MILITARY.
>> BOO!

name:James Cordan

text:>> James: AND THIS IS UNUSUAL,
USUALLY WHEN TRUMP WANTS TO EVEN
SOMEONE OUT OF MILITARY SERVICE,
HE JUST FAKES A DOCTOR'S NOTE
SAYING HE HAS A FOOT INJURY.
(LAUGHTER)
IT WORKED FINE FOR HIM DURING
VIETNAM.
NOW TRUMP SAYS THAT THIS MOVE IS
TO SAVE MONEY.

name:James Cordan

text:BUT ACCORDING TO ONE STUDY IF
YOU LOOK AT ALL THE MONEY THEY
SPENT ON HEALTH CARE FOR
TRANSGENDER SOLDIERS, THE
MILITARY SPENDS, AND THIS IS
TRUE, FIVE TIMES AS MUCH ON
PRESCRIPTIONS FOR VYING RA.
-- VIAGRA.
COMPLETELY TRUE, FIVE TIMESES AS
MUCH, TRUMP THINKS THAT

name:James Cordan

text:TRANSGENDER SOLDIERS AREN'T
NORMAL BUT 70 YEAR OLD MEN WITH
FULL BLOWN ERECTIONS ARE.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
NOW THIS REVERSES A POLICY THAT
O BMA PUT IF PLACE LAST YEAR.
AT THIS POINT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE
TRUMP WANTS TO DO THE OPPOSITE
OF EVERYTHING OBAMA DID HE IS
LIKE OH, OBAMA PARDONED A TAWR

name:James Cordan

text:KEY ON THANKSGIVING?
-- A TURKEY ON THANKSGIVING,
WELL I'M GOING TO SLAUGHTER A
TURKEY WITH A CHAINSAW ON THE
FRONT LAWN.
MEANWHILE IN OTHER CRAZY TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION NEWS, ENERGY
SECRETARY RICK PERRY RECENTLY
SPENT 20 MINUTES ON THE PHONE
TACKING TO THE PRIME MINISTER OF
THE UKRAINE, ONLY TO FIND OUT HE

name:James Cordan

text:WAS ACTUALLY BEING PRANKED BY BY
A RUSSIAN COMEDIAN.
SO IT LOOKS LIKE RUSSIA IS NOW 2
FOR 2 PRANKING AMERICA.
NOW IF ARE YOU NOT FAMILIAR WITH
TWO-TIME PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE
RICK PERRY, ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW
IS THAT HIS NUMBER ONE
QUALIFICATION FOR BEING ENERGY
SECRETARY IS THAT HE NOW WEARS
GLASSES.

name:James Cordan

text:(LAUGHTER)
I HAVE TO SAY, THIS IS
EMBARRASSING, IT IS.
BUT IT NOT HALF AS EMBARRASSING
AS RICK PERRY IS ON DANCING WITH
THE STARS AND THEY TRICKED HIM
INTO DOING THIS.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE).
>> James: HEY, GUYS, HERE IS A
FUN FACT.

name:James Cordan

text:THAT GUY IS NOW IN CHARGE OF
SAFEGUARDING AMERICA'S NUCLEAR
WEAPONS.
(LAUGHTER).

NOW FINALLY TONIGHT TWITTER WAS
ALL ABUZZ, IF YOU SAW THIS, IN A
RECENT PHOTO THAT DRAKE HAS A
TATTOO OF FELLOW RAPPER LIL

text:WAYNE ON HIS ARM.
TAKE A LOOK.
AND YOU SEE--

I LIKE THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE
BUZZING ABOUT THE LIL WAYNE
TATTOO BUT COMPLETELY IGNORING
THAT IT'S RIGHT UNDERNEATH, AND
THIS IS REAL, A TATTOO OF A
BOTTLE OF DRACO NOIR COLOGNE,

name:James Cordan

text:THAT IS COMPLETELY REAL.
AND IT BEGS THE QUESTION HOW
MANY BETS HAS DRAKE LOST.
NOW APPARENTLY DREAK AND LIL
WAYNE MADE AN AGREEMENT.
DRAKE SAID I WILL GET A TATTOO
OF YOU IF YOU GET A TATTOO OF
EVERY TATTOO.
(APPLAUSE)

text:LOTS TO TALK ABOUT IN THE NEWS
SO LET'S GET RIGHT INTO IT.
DURING AN INTERVIEW YESTERDAY,
BOB WOODWARD, THE VETERAN
JOURNALIST AND AUTHOR OF A NEW
BOOK DETAILING THE CHAOS AND
INSANITY INSIDE THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION, CONCLUDED BY
SAYING THAT PEOPLE NEED TO "WAKE
UP" TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE
WHITE HOUSE.

name:James Cordan

text:"WAKE UP?"
WE'RE AWAKE, BOB!
WE'RE AWAKE!
I HAVEN'T HAD A FULL NIGHT'S
SLEEP IN TWO YEARS!
TRUMP RESPONDED THIS MORNING
WITH A TWEET, SEEMINGLY LASHING
OUT AT WOODWARD.
HE WROTE, "THE ECONOMY IS SOOOO
GOOD, PERHAPS THE BEST IN OUR

text:COUNTRY'S HISTORY (REMEMBER,
IT'S THE ECONOMY STUPID!), THAT

MISSING AT THE BEGINNING IS "OH
MY GOD YOU GUYS."

text:"THE ECONOMY IS SO GOOD RIGHT
NOW..."
IN HIS TWEET, PRESIDENT TRUMP
WANTS YOU TO KNOW THE ECONOMY IS

SO HE BACKS UP HIS CLAIM WITH

I'M KIDDING.
THIS IS A MAN WHO USES FOUR O'S
IN "SOOOO GOOD."

MEANWHILE, FORMER PRESIDENT
BARACK OBAMA IS BACK ON THE
CAMPAIGN TRAIL TRYING TO RALLY
DEMOCRATS FOR THE MIDTERM
ELECTION, AND ON SATURDAY, WHILE
AT A STOP IN ANAHEIM, OBAMA

KICKED OUT OF DISNEYLAND FOR

AND LASHED OUT ON TWITTER,
WRITING: "INCONCEIVABLE THAT THE
GOVERNMENT WOULD BREAK INTO A
LAWYER'S OFFICE EARLY IN THE

THE ONLY THING INCONCEIVABLE
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING IS THAT

HE THEN WENT ON TO SAY, "THE

WHY EVEN BRING
OBAMA INTO THIS?

IMMEDIATELY COMPLAINED THAT

I'M JAMES CORDEN, HE'S REGGIE
WATTS AND HE'S SHAWN MENDES.
AND THIS IS THE LATE LATE SHOW.
HOPE EVERYBODY HAD A FANTASTIC
HALLOWEEN.
IT'S LATE AT NIGHT, AND IF
YOU'RE LIKE MOST PEOPLE, BY NOW
YOU'VE PUT THE KIDS TO BED AND
YOU'RE WORKING OUT JUST HOW MUCH

name:James Cordan

text:OF THEIR CANDY YOU CAN EAT
WITHOUT THEM NOTICING.
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
>> James:  THAT'S CERTAINLY
WHAT I'LL BE DOING BY THE TIME
YOU'RE WATCHING THIS.
AND SINCE YOU'RE IN THE SPIRIT,
LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME HALLOWEEN
STORIES IN THE NEWS.
SHALL WE DO THAT?

name:James Cordan

text:NOW, ACCORDING TO ECONOMISTS,
CONSUMERS SPENT $9 BILLION ON
HALLOWEEN MERCHANDISE THIS YEAR.
TO BE FAIR, THE BULK OF THAT $9
BILLION WAS SPENT BY ELTON JOHN.
THE SAME STUDY SAYS THAT
AMERICANS ARE SPENDING MORE AND
MORE EACH YEAR ON PET COSTUMES.
OR AS PETS CALL THAT:
HUMILIATION.

name:James Cordan

text:BUT IT WAS ALL WORTH IT WHEN YOU
SAW THAT BIG FAT BULLDOG DRESSED
UP LIKE A BAKED POTATO.
(LAUGHTER)
>> James:  TOTALLY WORTH IT.
MOVING ON, THIS WAS AN ODD
STORY.
A MAN IN LOUISIANA WAS ARRESTED
RECENTLY WHEN POLICE FOUND A BAG
OF CRYSTAL METH ON HIS
NIGHTSTAND, AND HE TOLD THE

name:James Cordan

text:OFFICERS THAT IT WAS PUT THERE
BY A "GHOST."
(LAUGHTER)
>> James:  I LIKE HOW WHEN
THIS GUY WAS QUESTIONED BY
POLICE, HE WAS LIKE, "OKAY, WHAT
WOULD SOMEBODY NOT ON METH
SAY...
IT WAS A GHOST!"
THE MAN SAID HE WAS SURE IT WAS
A GHOST, BECAUSE IT WAS A PALE,
SHADOWY FIGURE MAKING SCARY,

name:James Cordan

text:UNINTELLIGIBLE NOISES.
THEN HE WAS LIKE, "NOW THAT I'VE
SAID IT OUT LOUD, THAT WAS
PROBABLY JUST A GUY ON METH."
IT WAS PROBABLY DAVE!
IN OTHER SPOOKY NEWS, FORMER
FIRST DAUGHTER JENNA BUSH HAGER
RECENTLY REVEALED AN INTERESTING
FACT ABOUT LIVING IN THE WHITE

name:James Cordan

text:HOUSE.
SHE THINKS IT MIGHT BE HAUNTED.
NO WORD ON WHETHER IT'S STILL
HAUNTED, BUT THE PERSON IN THERE
NOW SURE HAS A LOT OF SKELETONS
IN HIS CLOSET.
QUHEECHIERP
>> James:  SHE SAID WHAT
REALLY TIPPED HER OFF WAS THE
TIME SHE WOKE UP AND FOUND A BAG

name:James Cordan

text:OF CRYSTAL METH ON THE
NIGHTSTAND.
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY
REAL GHOSTS IN THE WHITE HOUSE,
BUT RIGHT NOW THERE'S DEFINITELY
SOME PEOPLE WHO LIKE TO WEAR
WHITE SHEETS.
EXACTLY, WHOOOO OORVES!
OOOO!

name:James Cordan

text:TALK ABOUT THAT, NOT RACIST!
AND THIS IS SCARY, A HALLOWEEN
DISPLAY AT A NORTH DAKOTA HOME
WAS SO TERRIFYING THAT CONCERNED
NEIGHBORS ACTUALLY CALLED THE
POLICE.
HERE'S THE DISPLAY RIGHT HERE.
AND I WANT TO WARN YOU, IT'S
PRETTY UPSETTING.

name:James Cordan

text:TAKE A LOOK.
>> James:  I'M KIDDING.
ALTHOUGH THAT IS TERRIFYING.
THE REAL DISPLAY WAS A "HELP ME"
SIGN WRITTEN IN FAKE BLOOD.
HERE'S AN ACTUAL PHOTO.
LOOK AT THAT!

name:James Cordan

text:I HAVE TO ADMIT, I FOUND THIS
PRETTY TERRIFYING.
THE IDEA OF AN ADULT STILL
GETTING THAT INTO HALLOWEEN
DECORATIONS.
THE OWNER DIDN'T GET THE HINT
THOUGH.
WHEN THE SWAT TEAM KNOCKED ON
THE DOOR WITH THEIR GUNS DRAWN,
SHE WAS LIKE, "OOOOH, AND WHO
ARE YOU ALL SUPPOSED TO BE?"

name:James Cordan

text:AND FINALLY, IN PUMPKIN NEWS, OR
AS PUMPKINS CALL IT, THE NEWS, I
APPRECIATE IT, PUMPKINS DON'T
GET NEWS!
WHY WOULD A PUMPKIN GET THE
NEWS?
I'VE EATEN QUITE A LOT OF SUGAR
TODAY.
A MAN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE RECENTLY
BROKE A RECORD FOR THE LARGEST
PUMPKIN GROWN IN NORTH AMERICA,
WEIGHING IN AT OVER 2,500

name:James Cordan

text:POUNDS.
WHICH MEANS THE PREVIOUS RECORD
HOLDER FOR THE WORLD'S LARGEST
PUMPKIN NOW HAS TO RETHINK HIS
ENTIRE LIFE.
2,500 POUNDS!
THAT'S NOT A PUMPKIN, THAT'S A
FORD FIESTA WITH A STEM.
THAT PUMPKIN IS IMPRESSIVE.

name:James Cordan

text:I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING THAT BIG
AND ORANGE SINCE... WELL...
(APPLAUSE)
>> James:  COME ON, WE HAD TO
DO THAT JOKE.
IT WAS TOO EASY!

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING
HERE.

TONIGHT.
WE APPRECIATE YOU STAYING UP.
THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT,

LET'S MOVE RIGHT INTO THE
HEADLINES.
THIS MORNING, PRESIDENT TRUMP
TOOK TO TWITTER TO VOICE HIS
CONCERN ABOUT RUSSIA POSSIBLY
MEDDLING IN THE MIDTERM

name:James Cordan

text:ELECTIONS THIS FALL.
HE TWEETED: "I'M VERY CONCERNED
THAT RUSSIA WILL BE FIGHTING
VERY HARD TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON
THE UPCOMING ELECTION.
BASED ON THE FACT THAT NO
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN TOUGHER ON
RUSSIA THAN ME, THEY WILL BE
PUSHING VERY HARD FOR THE
DEMOCRATS.

text:THEY DEFINITELY DON'T WANT
TRUMP!"
[ LAUGHTER ]
FINALLY, SOMETHING AMERICANS AND
RUSSIANS CAN AGREE ON.
NONE OF US WANT TRUMP!
[ LAUGHTER ]
[ CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ]
I READ THAT TWEET, TOUGH ON
RUSSIA?

name:James Cordan

text:WHO IS HE KIDDING?
THE ONLY THING IN RUSSIA TRUMP
HAS BEEN TOUGH ON IS THEIR HOTEL
BED SHEETS.
[ LAUGHTER ]
[ CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ]
MEANWHILE, THE RUSSIA
INVESTIGATION IS STILL GOING ON.
AND NOW PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS
REPORTEDLY AGREED TO AN

text:INTERVIEW WITH SPECIAL COUNSEL
ROBERT MUELLER'S TEAM, BUT ONLY
IF THEY LEAVE OUT ANY QUESTIONS
ABOUT OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
OR, IN COMPLICATED LEGAL TERMS,
"DON'T ASK ME ABOUT ANY OF THE
BAD STUFF I DID."
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW I'M NOT A LAWYER, BUT ASKING
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL NOT TO ASK
YOU ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT

name:James Cordan

text:OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE SEEMS
LIKE SOME FORM OF OBSTRUCTION OF
JUSTICE.
[ LAUGHTER ]
THIS IS LIKE WHEN YOUR FRIEND
SAYS, "DO NOT ASK ME HOW I GOT
THIS SCAR."
[ LAUGHTER ]
WELL NOW THAT YOU'VE POINTED IT
OUT, IT'S LITERALLY THE ONLY
THING I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT.

MOVING ON, AT THE TOUR DE FRANCE
TODAY, THE POLICE WERE TRYING TO
CONTROL PROTESTORS AT THE RACE
BY SPRAYING TEAR GAS, BUT THEY
HELD UP THE RACE BECAUSE THEY
ACCIDENTALLY SPRAYED THE
CYCLISTS.
SEE?
INCIDENTS LIKE THIS ARE WHY I
REFUSE TO COMPETE 23-DAY BIKE

name:James Cordan

text:RACES.
[ LAUGHTER ]
I WILL NOT DO IT!
THEY HALTED THE RACE BECAUSE OF
TEAR GAS?
THAT'S THE LEAST DANGEROUS
CHEMICAL THE AVERAGE TOUR DE

IN OTHER PROFESSIONAL CYCLING

THAT'S IT FOR CYCLING NEWS.
CAN YOU IMAGINE?
YOU REALLY THOUGHT I WAS GOING
TO DO A WHOLE MONOLOGUE ABOUT
CYCLING?
NO!

name:James Cordan

text:AND THIS WAS A SHOCKING STORY, A
MAN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WAS
ARRESTED AFTER WALKING AROUND A
PLANET FITNESS GYM COMPLETELY
NAKED.
HE DEFENDED HIMSELF BY TELLING
OFFICERS HE THOUGHT IT WAS A
"JUDGMENT FREE ZONE," BECAUSE
THAT'S THE GYM'S MOTTO.
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO APPARENTLY, THERE IS SUCH A

name:James Cordan

text:THING AS TOO MUCH BODY
POSITIVITY.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, THE REST OF
THE GYM MEMBERS GOT SOME GREAT
CARDIO RUNNING OUT OF THE
BUILDING SCREAMING.
[ LAUGHTER ]
ACCORDING TO REPORTS, WHEN THE
COPS SHOWED UP, THEY FOUND THE
NAKED MAN SITTING IN A YOGA

STORY.

WONDERING, "IS THIS BECAUSE I
CONSUMED SALMONELLA OR BECAUSE I
CONSUMED AN ENTIRE BOX OF RITZ
CHEESE CRACKER SANDWICHES?"

WHAT?
I MEAN, I KNOW WE'RE IN LOS
ANGELES.
YOU'VE NEVER SOUNDED MORE LIKE A
LOS ANGELES AUDIENCE THAN IN

DID HE JUST SAY "CARBS?
OH!"
HOW WAS THE SHOW?
IT WAS GOOD, BUT HE TALKED ABOUT
CARBS!
OH.
RITZ HAD TO RECALL THE PRODUCTS
BEFORE MAKING MORE PEOPLE SICK.

NOW, IF YOU'RE ANYTHING LIKE ME,

name:James Cordan

text:THE ONLY THING THAT YOU AND YOUR
FRIENDS ARE TALKING ABOUT IS THE
ALABAMA SENATE RACE, AND TODAY
WAS THE BIG ELECTION BETWEEN
DOUG JONES AND CONTROVERSIAL
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE ROY MOORE.

WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS MORNING
IN THE BREAK ROOM OVER A CUP OF
JOE.
IN THE PAST THREE MONTHS,
AIRLINES EARNED A RECORD

text:$1.2 BILLION JUST IN BAGGAGE
FEES!
( LAUGHTER )
BUT, I SHOULD SAY, THEY ONLY
RECEIVED HALF OF THE MONEY.
THE AIRLINES LOST THE OTHER
HALF.
THEY THINK IT MIGHT BE IN

QUITE SURE YET.

YOU GUYS IN A HURRY?
YOU GOING ANYWHERE?
YOU HAVE A SECOND TO STAY?
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I'LL ONLY TAKE A COUPLE OF

THIS GUY HAS TO LIVE WITH THE
FACT THAT LAST YEAR DURING A

TRAMPLED A BEST BUY CASHIER TO
DEATH.

SNOW BUT BECAUSE HE'S SUPER
RACIST.

I DON'T WRITE THEM.
I'M JUST FILLING IN.

PENCE OR PRESIDENT BARACK THE
ROCK, WHOEVER IS THE PRESIDENT
WHEN I GET BACK.

text:WE'LL DO THAT.
(APPLAUSE)
BUT WHILE WE'RE STILL HERE ON
AMERICAN SOIL, WE THOUGHT WE
WOULD DO A COUPLE OF STORIES
THAT COULD ONLY HAPPEN HERE IN
THESE UNITED STATES.
AND THIS IS A STORY WE THOUGHT
WAS CRAZY.
A TEXAS MAN WENT ON A DATE TO
SEE GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY

text:2-RBGS RIGHT?
AND IS NOW SUING HIS DATE FOR
TEXTING DURING THE MOVIE.

HE THINKS HE CAN SUE HER FOR
TEXTING.
WHO DOES THIS MAN THINK HE IS?
THE GUARDIAN OF THE SAMSUNG
GALAXY.

text:(APPLAUSE)
(LAUGHTER)
TWO YEARS, TWO YEARS WE'VE BEEN
ON THE AIR.
TOO LATE.
NOW THE MAN SAID, THE MAN SAID
TEXTING DURING A MOVIE IS ONE OF
MY BIGGEST PET PEEVES, RIGHT.
NOW PET PEEVES ARE NOT WHAT
LAWSUITS ARE FOR.

name:James Cordan

text:YOU DON'T SUE SOMEONE BECAUSE
THEY SAY EXPRESSO INSTEAD OF
ESPRESSO.
IT IS GOING TO MAKE IT VERY HARD
FOR HIM ON FUTURE DATES.
LIKE HE'S GOING TO BE LIKE HOW
DID YOUR LAST RELATIONSHIP END,
AND HE WILL BE LIKE, ON AN
EPISODE OF JUDGE JUDY.
HERE'S THE STORY WE THOUGHT WAS
NUTS.

name:James Cordan

text:A MAN IN WEST VIRGINIA WAS
ARRESTED FOR BURGLARY AFTER
STEALING HIS RELATIVE'S HOME
SECURITY SYSTEM, ALL RIGHT?
AND WHEN HE WAS QUESTIONED ABOUT
THE THEFT, HE SAID HE ONLY DID
IT BECAUSE HE WAS WORRIED HE HAD
BEEN CAUGHT ON CAMERA
MASTURBATING AT HER HOUSE.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)

name:James Cordan

text:YOU ONLY IN WEST VIRGINIA WOULD
YOU PLEAD YOUR INNOCENCE BY
GOING, NO, NO, NO, YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND, NO, I CAN EXPLAIN.
I ONLY TOOK IT BECAUSE I WAS
MASTURBATING ON MY GRANDMOTHER'S
COUCH.
(LAUGHTER)
BUT SOMETHING GOOD HAS COME OUT
OF THIS.

name:James Cordan

text:AT LEAST NOW WE ALL KNOW WHY
GRANDMA HAS PLASTIC SLIP COVERS
ON HER COUCH.

THIS WAS A FUN STORY WE LIKED.
AT A WAL-MART IN MINNESOTA A
CUSTOMER HAD TO TACKLE A
CONFUSED DEER AFTER IT WANDERED
INTO THE STORE.
ALL RIGHT?

name:James Cordan

text:THE DEER IS FINE, AN WAS
RELEASED BACK INTO THE WILD,
WHICH MAKES THIS THE HAPPIEST
POSSIBLE ENDING TO A STORY OF A
DEER WALKING INTO ONE OF
AMERICA'S LARGEST SUPPLIERS OF
HUNTING RIFLES.
(LAUGHTER)
AND IT IS GOOD FOR THE STORE
TOO.

CAPITALIZE ON THIS BY CHANGING
THEIR SLOGAN TO WAL-MART, WHERE
YOU CAN ALWAYS SAVE A BUCK.

AND FINALLY TONIGHT, WE WANTED
TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO A NEW

name:James Cordan

text:TREND RIGHT HERE IN THESE
AMERICAN STATES.
PEOPLE IN SOME BIG CITIES HAVE
STARTED TO DO SOMETHING CALLED
SOLOGAMY.
NOW IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT
IS, IT IS WHERE YOU HAVE A
WEDDING WITH JUST ONE PERSON IN
IT, AND YOU GET MARRIED TO
YOURSELF.

name:James Cordan

text:(LAUGHTER)
I THINK I KNOW A GUARDIANS OF
THE GALAXY FAN WHO MIGHT LIKE
THIS.
(APPLAUSE)
IT IS A TRUE THING.
YOU INVITE PEOPLE AND THEN YOU
JUST MARRY YOURSELF.
LIKE ONE WOMAN WHO SAID THAT SHE
GOTD TIRED OF PEOPLE ASKING WHY
SHE WAS STILL SINGLE.

name:James Cordan

text:YEAH, MARRYING YOURSELF IS
REALLY GOING TO STOP PEOPLE
ASKING YOU ANYTHING.
IT'S PROBABLY FUN THROWING A BIG
PARTY FOR YOURSELF, BUT IT'S GOT
TO GET A LITTLE OLD OPENING ALL
OF THOSE WEDDING PRESENTS BEING
LIKE OH, GREAT, ANOTHER
VIBRATOR.
OH GREAT, ANOTHER ONE.

text:NO, IT IS A MASSAGER.
I TELL YOU WHAT IS HARDEST ABOUT
THIS, IS THE PROPOSAL.
IS IT NOT KNOWING IF YOU ARE
GOING TO GET A YES.

KNOW IF I'M READY TO COMMIT,

SOME GOOD NEWS OUT OF THE
NATION'S CAPITAL, IT LOOKS LIKE
CONGRESS HAS AGREED ON A
BIPARTISAN SPENDING DEAL TO
AVOID ANOTHER POSSIBLE
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.

name:James Cordan

text:IT'S A GOOD COMPROMISE.
NEGOTIATORS SAY THERE'S ENOUGH
IN THE DEAL TO MAKE BOTH SIDES
COMPLETELY MISERABLE.
( LAUGHTER )
THIS NEW BUDGET DEAL GIVES
PRESIDENT TRUMP ONLY ENOUGH
FUNDING TO BUILD 55 MILES OF
BORDER WALL, WHICH WILL STOP
ANYONE IN THEIR TRACKS UNLESS

text:THEY'RE WILLING TO TRAVEL 56
MILES.
( LAUGHTER )
IT'S ESSENTIALLY THE MOST
EXPENSIVE "DETOUR" SIGN YOU'VE
EVER SEEN.
( LAUGHTER )
AFTER ALL THE HEADACHES AND THE
DRAMA OF A MONTH-LONG GOVERNMENT
SHUTDOWN, TRUMP ENDED UP WITH
THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR A
WALL THAT HE WAS OFFERED BEFORE

name:James Cordan

text:THE SHUTDOWN STARTED.
( LAUGHTER )
THAT'S RIGHT, ANOTHER MASTERFUL
DEAL FOR PRESIDENT BUSINESS.
( LAUGHTER )
SPEAKING OF THE WALL, LAST
NIGHT, PRESIDENT TRUMP HELD A
RALLY IN EL PASO, TEXAS, WHERE
HE INTRODUCED A NEW SLOGAN.

name:James Cordan

text:YOU CAN SEE IT ON THE BANNER
BEHIND HIM HERE.
IT SAYS "FINISH THE WALL."

IN TRUMP'S TWO YEARS IN OFFICE,
ZERO MILES OF WALL HAVE BEEN
BUILT ALONG A 2,000 MILE BORDER.
AND NOW HE'S SAYING "FINISH THE
WALL."
( LAUGHTER )
TRUMP'S NEXT BANNER IS JUST

name:James Cordan

text:GOING TO SAY "THE WALL IS
FINISHED, BUT DON'T GO LOOKING
FOR IT OR ANYTHING.
JUST TRUST US."
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
DURING THE RALLY, TRUMP TOUCHED
UPON A LOT OF TOPICS, INCLUDING
WHY HE'S THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN
MORE THAN 100 YEARS NOT TO HAVE
A WHITE HOUSE PET.

name:James Cordan

text:HERE HE IS EXPLAINING IT, TAKE A
LOOK.
>> HOW WOULD I LOOK WALKING A
DOG ON THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN?
( CHEERING )
FEELS A LITTLE PHONY -- PHONY TO
ME.
>> JAMES: RIGHT, THE FAKE
BILLIONAIRE WITH THE FAKE TAN
AND FAKE HAIR WOULDN'T WANT TO
SEEM PHONY.

name:James Cordan

text:( LAUGHTER )
I THINK TRUMP IS JUST COVERING
UP FOR THE FACT THAT HE'S TOO
SELFISH TO EVEN PLAY FETCH WITH
A DOG.
( LAUGHTER )
HE'S LIKE, "YOU WANT THE STICK?
YOU WANT THE STICK?
TOO BAD, LOSER!

name:James Cordan

text:THIS IS MY STICK."
( LAUGHTER )
GET OUT OF HERE, YOU LOSER,
YOU'RE FAKE NEWS.

SO, IT SOUNDS LIKE TRUMP'S NEVER
GOING TO HAVE A WHITE HOUSE PET.

GO TO THE SENATE AND FEED SOME

NEW JERSEY IS THE FIRST STATE TO
LEGALIZE BETTING ON THE AWARDS
SHOW.
THIS IS SO DISRESPECTFUL.
THEY'RE TAKING SOMETHING
INNOCENT LIKE HOLLYWOOD AND

text:MAKING IT ALL ABOUT MONEY.

AT LEAST IF YOU LOSE ALL YOUR
MONEY BETTING ON THE ACADEMY
AWARDS, YOU'LL END UP WITH
A COOL STORY.
"HOW'D I GET HERE?
WELL, IT ALL STARTS WITH RAMI
MALEK AND GLENN CLOSE."

text:( LAUGHTER )
I SHOULD GET RID OF THIS.

ALTHOUGH THIS YEAR'S NOMINEES

LET'S GET RIGHT INTO THE NEWS.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PRESIDENT
TRUMP WAS BACK AT IT THIS
MORNING CRITICIZING SPECIAL
COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER'S RUSSIA
INVESTIGATION.
AND HE DID IT WITH A TWEET
RIDDLED WITH ERRORS.

name:James Cordan

text:EVEN FOR DONALD TRUMP, THERE
WERE A LOT OF TYPOS.
HE TWEETED SPECIAL COUNCIL,
COUNSEL SPELLED WRONG, IS TOLD
TO FIND CRIMES WETHER, SPELLED
WRONG, CRIMES EXIST OR NOT.
I WAS OPPOSED THE THE, YES,
DOUBLE THE, SELECTION OF MUELLER
TO BE SPECIAL COUNCIL, AGAIN
WRONG SPELLING OF COUNSEL.
I AM STILL OPPOSED TO IT I THINK
PRESIDENT TRUMP, YEAH, HERE HE

name:James Cordan

text:SWITCHED TO THE THIRD PERSON,
WAS RIGHT WHEN HE SAID THERE
NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SPECIAL
COUNCIL, AGAIN WRONG SPELLING,
APPOINTED BECAUSE-- END OF
TWEET.
I MEAN--
(LAUGHTER)
AT THIS POINT EVEN TRUMP'S AUTO
CORRECT IS LIKE I CAN'T WITH
THIS GUY.

name:James Cordan

text:I QUIT.
NO MORE.
I'M OUT.
DONE.
(APPLAUSE)
WHAT IS TERRIFYING IS TWEETING
IS THE ONE THING DONALD TRUMP IS
GOOD AT.

name:James Cordan

text:HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.
YOU IMAGINE THIS GUY TRYING TO
MAKE A SANDWICH--
(LAUGHTER)
>> PUTTING PEANUT BUTTER ON BOTH
SIDES OF THE BREAD AND THEN
PUTTING IT IN A MICROWAVE UNTIL
IT CATCHES FIRE.
NOW THE REASON THAT TRUMP
SWITCHED TO THE THIRD PERSON IN

name:James Cordan

text:THE MIDDLE OF THE TWEET IS
BECAUSE HE WAS QUOTING ALAN
DERSHOWITZ, AN ADVISOR TO
O.J. SIMPSON DURING HIS MURDER
TRIAL BECAUSE WHAT BETTER WAY TO
PROVE YOUR INNOCENCE THAN BY
SAYING SEE, O.J.'S LAWYER SAID I
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.
(APPLAUSE)
IN OTHER WHITE HOUSE NEWS, IT
WAS REVEALED YESTERDAY THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP CONGRATULATED

name:James Cordan

text:RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN
OVER THE PHONE FOR WINNING HIS
CONTROVERSIAL RE-ELECTION, EVEN
THOUGH HIS ADVISORS WROTE IN ALL
CAPITAL LETTERS ON HIS NOTE
CARDS, DO NOT CONGRATULATE.
NOW YOU CAN SEE WHAT WENT WRONG
HERE, THE WHITE HOUSE ADVISORS
DIDN'T FOLLOW PROTOCOL.
YOU CAN'T JUST GIVE HIM A CARD.

name:James Cordan

text:YOU NEED TO WRITE DOWN DO NOT
CONGRATULATE IN AN EMAIL, SEND
THAT EMAIL TO FOX NEWS, SEAN
HANNITY WILL THEN READ IT TO HIM
ON THE AIR.
THAT IS HOW YOU GET A MESSAGE
ACROSS.
(APPLAUSE)
THE CAPITOL LETTERS WERE GOOD
BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SPEAK
IN TRUMP'S LAN GEAJ THE

name:James Cordan

text:INSTRUCTIONS SHOULD HAVE BEEN
WRITTEN AS DU NUT CON GRADUATE
THE THE PUTIN.
WE HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WOULD
HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT.
MOVING ON, LET'S MOVE ON TO
ANOTHER STORY THE PRESIDENT
DOESN'T WANT YOU TO HEAR ABOUT.
A FORMER PLAYBOY MOD WHEL CLAIMS
THAT SHE HAD AN AFFAIR WITH

name:James Cordan

text:DONALD TRUMP HAS FILED A LAWSUIT
TO BREAK A HUSH AGREEMENT SO
THAT SHE COULD SPEAK OPENLY
ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP.
TRUMP PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE SEEN
THIS COMING BECAUSE IN HER
CENTER FOLD SHE LISTED HER
BOBBY-- HOBBIES AS SKIING,
COOKING, BREAKING HUSH
AGREEMENTS AND BEACH VOLLEYBALL.
ALTHOUGH YOU'VE GOT TO HAND IT
TO TRUMP.

name:James Cordan

text:BETWEEN PLAYBOY MODELS, PORN
STARS AN HAVING HIS OWN
HELICOPTER, HE'S LIVING OUT
EVERY 14 YEAR OLD BOY'S FANTASY
EVERY DAY.
(APPLAUSE)
AND FINALLY, "THE WALL STREET
JOURNAL" HAS PUBLISHED THE
RESULTS OF PORN STAR STORMY
DANIEL'S 2011 POLY GRAPH TEST
ABOUT HER AFFAIR WITH DONALD

name:James Cordan

text:TRUMP.
AND THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT SHE
IS TELLING THE TRUTH.
THANKS FOR GOING THE EXTRA MILE,
WAWJ.
BUT HON-- "THE WALL STREET
JOURNAL," BUT HONESTLY, NOBODY
DOUBTED THE STORY.
WHY WOULD YOU MAKE IT UP?

name:James Cordan

text:STORMY DANIELS WAS COMPLETELY
TRUTHFUL.
IN FACT, THE TEST REVEALED THAT
SHE HASN'T LIED SINCE SHE FAKED
AN ORGASM WITH DONALD TRUMP.
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
SO THIS STORY HAS CAUSED A LOT
OF PANIC IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
IN FACT, WHEN TRUMP'S STAFF
HEARD THAT STORMY DANIELS HAD

name:James Cordan

text:PASSED HER POLY GRAPH TEST THEY
HANDED HIM A NOTE REALLY QUICKLY
THAT SAID, DO NOT CONGRATULATE!
GUYS, AS YOU KNOW, TOMORROW IS
THANKSGIVING, WHICH
IS A DAY WHERE AMERICANS
CELEBRATE WHAT THEY HAVE, BEFORE
REALIZING THEY NEED MORE AND
DITCHING DINNER TO SIT IN A TENT
OUTSIDE OF BEST BUY.

name:James Cordan

text:[LAUGHTER]
NOW THIS IS MY VERY FIRST
THANKSGIVING, AND I'M VERY
EXCITED.
[APPLAUSE]
BUT FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN HEARING
FROM EVERYONE, YOUR
LEAD-UP TO THANKSGIVING IS KIND
OF LIKE OUR LEAD-UP TO
CHRISTMAS.
YOU GUYS DO THIS, RIGHT?

name:James Cordan

text:THE NIGHT BEFORE A BIG HOLIDAY,
YOU GO OUT TO A BAR IN THE TOWN
YOU GREW UP IN TO DRINK LEGALLY
WHERE EVERYONE USED TO DRINK
ILLEGALLY, WITH THE SAME PEOPLE.
EXCEPT TODAY, THE MYSTERY'S ALL
GONE IN SEEING HOMETOWN FRIENDS,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT EVERYONE
IS UP TO BECAUSE OF
FACEBOOK.

name:James Cordan

text:SOMEONE'S PREGNANT, SOMEONE'S
DIVORCED, SOMEONE'S MAKING
JEWELRY, AND EVERYONE'S FAT.
[LAUGHTER]
WHICH IS A RELIEF.
[APPLAUSE]
IT REALLY IS.
BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO GO, THOUGH.
YOU HAVE TO GO TO THAT BAR
BECAUSE THERE IS A CHANCE YOU
MIGHT RUN INTO THAT ONE GIRL

name:James Cordan

text:FROM THE VOLLEYBALL TEAM THAT
YOU ALWAYS HAD A THING FOR.
YOU KNOW THE ONE.
YOU SEE HER.
YOU'RE AFRAID TO GET HER NUMBER,
BUT SIX SHOTS LATER, YOU FINALLY
GET THE COURAGE TO STEAL HER
NUMBER FROM SOMEONE ELSE'S
PHONE.
WHICH MEANS THAT RIGHT NOW,
YOU'RE UP IN YOUR CHILDHOOD

name:James Cordan

text:BEDROOM, WATCHING ME ON A TV
THAT'S PROBABLY ABOUT THAT SIZE,
STARING AT THE PHONE NUMBER
THINKING, SHALL I CALL HER?
AND WOULD SHE HOOK UP WITH YOU
IN FRONT OF YOUR "STAR WARS"
ACTION FIGURES?
WE ALL KNOW THE ANSWER.
OF COURSE SHE WOULD.
[LAUGHTER]
SHE'S GOING THROUGH A

name:James Cordan

text:DIVORCE.
THIS IS PART OF HER JOURNEY.
[APPLAUSE]
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE THE
RISK, SO YOU DECIDE TO GO TO HER
PLACE.
BUT YOU'RE TOO DRUNK TO DRIVE,
AND YOU THINK YOU'VE FIGURED IT
OUT.

name:James Cordan

text:YOU'LL CALL AN UBER.
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS -- UBER
HASN'T MADE IT TO THE SUBURBS
WHERE YOUR PARENTS LIVE YET.
THE CLOSEST UBER IS TWO STATES
AWAY.
SO YOU GO DOWN TO THE BOARD
WHERE YOUR MOM KEEPS HER KEYS.
YOU SEE THE BUSINESS CARD FROM A
CAB COMPANY THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN

name:James Cordan

text:THERE SINCE YOUR CHILDHOOD.
AND YOU THINK THAT IS IT.
YES, THIS IS IT.
YOU'RE GOING TO GET LAID
TONIGHT.
YOU CALL UP.
SINCE 1998.
[LAUGHTER]
AND YOU JUST FALL ASLEEP.
THEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING,

name:James Cordan

text:AND HERE'S WHERE IT GETS
DIFFERENT FROM BRITISH HOLIDAYS.
ON THANKSGIVING HERE, YOU GUYS
WAKE UP TO YOUR MOM SAYING THAT
YOU'RE MISSING THE PARADE.
AM I RIGHT?
YOU GUYS ARE INTO THIS PARADE.
YOU GUYS LOVE THIS PARADE, RIGHT
REGGIE?
THIS IS A BIG THING.

name:James Cordan

text:REGGIE: THAT IS CORRECT.
JAMES: I CAN UNDERSTAND WATCHING
IT AT HOME, BUT WHY WOULD YOU GO
TO SEE IT IN PERSON?
IT IS NOVEMBER IN NEW YORK.
IT IS 4 DEGREES.
EVEN THE PILLS BRIE DOUGH BOY
BALLOON HAS HARD NIPPLES.
BUT THEN THE PARADE ENDS, AND IF
IT'S ANYTHING LIKE CHRISTMAS

name:James Cordan

text:WHERE I'M FROM, YOU HAVE YOUR
THANKSGIVING DINNER AT THE SAME
TIME YOU HAVE DINNER EVERY
NIGHT.
2 P.M.
HOW AM I DOING SO FAR?
IS THIS WHAT THANKSGIVING IS
LIKE?
IS THAT IT?
AM I ON POINT?

name:James Cordan

text:AND I JUST KNOW AS YOU'RE HAVING
YOUR DINNER, YOUR MOM WILL ASK
YOU IF YOU'RE DATING ANYONE EVEN
THOUGH SHE KNOWS THE ANSWER IS
NO, BUT THE SALT FROM YOUR TEARS
REALLY HELPS
SEASON THE MASHED POTATOES.
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER, CHRISTMAS
OR THANKSGIVING, YOUR MOM
OVERCOOKED THE TURKEY, BUT
YOU'RE LIKE, "I SHOULDN'T SAY
ANYTHING, I SHOULD JUST BE

name:James Cordan

text:GRATEFUL THAT SHE WORKED SO HARD
ON THIS DINNER AND THAT I'M WITH
MY LOVED ONES."
AND THEN YOUR DAD HAS ONE
MOUTHFUL AND IS LIKE, "MARGARET,
YOU RUINED THE
TURKEY!"
THEN ONE OF MY FAVORITE HOLIDAY
TRADITIONS IS WHEN EVERYONE'S
LIKE, "WE SHOULD WATCH A MOVIE."
SO YOU DEBATE WHICH MOVIE TO
WATCH FOR LIKE SEVEN HOURS.

name:James Cordan

text:HERE'S THE THING THOUGH, NO
MATTER HOW SAFE YOU THINK THE
MOVIE YOU PICKED IS, THERE'S
ALWAYS NUDITY.
IN THE FILM.
AND YOU HAVE THAT MOMENT WHEN
YOU'RE LEFT STARING AT THE
SCREEN DURING A SEX SCENE
WHILE YOUR FATHER CLEARS HIS
THROAT AND EVERYBODY PRETENDS
IT ISN'T HAPPENING.

name:James Cordan

text:[LAUGHTER]
AND THEN EVERYONE JUST PASSES
OUT BEFORE THE MOVIE ENDS, BUT
YOU'LL WAKE
UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
FOR MORE LEFTOVERS, WHICH IS THE
BEST PART OF IT, THAT MIDNIGHT
JOURNEY.
BUT THEN YOU STRUGGLE WITH HOW
TO GET ALL OF
THE LEFTOVER DISHES TO FIT BACK
IN THE FRIDGE.

name:James Cordan

text:IT'LL BE LIKE TETRIS WITH
YAMS.
[LAUGHTER]
YOU'LL FALL BACK ASLEEP SOUND IN
THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU WON'T
HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS
EXPERIENCE AGAIN -- FOR ONE
WHOLE MONTH.
HAPPY THANKSGIVING,
EVERYONE.
WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT, WE REALLY DO.

quite simple hotel room in Norway and
what I realize is just one switch so one

the whole room so hoorah this is still
easy because normally you know you've
got to find the switch for different

fiddling from the knee the wire is it on

everything up and this is off to my gig

late and I just thought I'll just switch
that off

got binoculars I'm busy it's not a good

name:Michael McIntyre

people and you can see the people who
see better than other people if they're
glasses or don't have glasses I have
contact lenses I'm short-sighted some

name:Michael McIntyre

text:people are long-sighted
which is that well short-sighted means
you struggle to see in the distance that
I think is better let's mine one
non-standard people they can see fine
actually quite well in the distance but

name:Michael McIntyre

text:they can't see in there so right in
front of their face that must be very
frustrating because they can see fine of
reverb their lives do people come on I
don't know
sorry it stopped I dunno you come back

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Justin I'm long-sighted
the prescription for my glasses my whole
life - 3.25 and when I need glasses or
who break them under contact lense I
just get the same prescription I haven't
been back to the optician since I was a

name:Michael McIntyre

text:kid I just know that because it works
you're not a minute they're worse also
don't want to feel tuition I don't know
what it's like nowadays but I remember
it being so so boring so confusing I
didn't know quite what was going on they

name:Michael McIntyre

text:would show like a green circle and a red
circle and then give you this this lens
which was the same on both sides you can
see it as de su amigo just focus on the
green circle in their internal is it
clear

name:Michael McIntyre

text:I'm sorry I don't know what you're
asking me I'm trying it's the same I
think it's the same on the green circle
on the rent so is it clear a one or two
should we say one and move on with our
is the letters do you know where the

name:Michael McIntyre

text:idea though chart for the letters so
they have a big letter and then have
rows of smaller letters the big one is
just there to start you off you know to
get even into it you know give you some
confidence everyone can see that one

name:Michael McIntyre

text:it's very rare most people age they
start off with confidence H they go yeah
I'm off let's go okay CVG
I'm getting a cue I'm thinking but you
feel really good about yourself as you
race through them yeah why these are the

name:Michael McIntyre

text:easy ones baby I'm undo this and then
when you get to one you can't see you
can't see it this is the key moment of
the itis this is the reason you booked
the eye test it's the reason the
optician trained in optometry so that

name:Michael McIntyre

text:you can at this moment go oh no not oh
that probably confuses
you go stop I can't see I can't see that
one this didn't help me now that's why
I'm here I could see the one before
which I think was an F but this one I'm

name:Michael McIntyre

text:completely in the dark only you can help
me it's why I've come to you in this
home of vision hurry now we don't do
that no we choose to guess the letter
which completely defeats the purpose
you don't win the glasses

name:Michael McIntyre

text:but you're there sort of strain in going
T straining just relax
so I gonna get it right and go it turns
out darling I don't need glasses
I just need to squint
to the rest of my life if I'm like

name:Michael McIntyre

text:much better
I got tea and I didn't even notice it
it's a carpet in history that someone is
axe let me guess to all the letters
correctly you tell me their letters in
front of me okay well let's say be shall

name:Michael McIntyre

text:we say s the final is that one more you
say okay let's go for G you have 20/20

conventions of the theater I love coming

name:Michael McIntyre

text:in this stage door I love the wings

go out in the wings
I'm also a big part of theatres on cause
at the end of a show you know you have
an encore I don't know why it's built

name:Michael McIntyre

text:into the show they asked you before will
you be doing an encore it's like they
assume you have to hold jokes back it's
not like you're doing it again
even though it's French for again you
don't do it again you come back and go

name:Michael McIntyre

text:oh yes do you love me it's very awkward
even if they don't you have to because
it's you know they leave the lights it's
awful anyway I'll do this gig last year
in a lovely theatre called the Mayflower
in Southampton so I finish the show

name:Michael McIntyre

text:anyway thank you thanks very much and
basically what you do at the end this
show is you I bow it is and then I go
off into the wings and then they just
wait behind the curtain here for a few I
just count to 10 and then they keep

name:Michael McIntyre

text:cheering and then I come back and go
thank you thank Ramon

skit in Southampton where I went off but

over here oh they popped the boot open
as well once you've got a certain amount
of money this this and this those days

treacherous for other people walking in

trolley trail for a pound all the way
over there and back for a pound the

of the Sid Vicious quote when Sid
Vicious was I saw that his music and
I've met the man in this gene he said
yeah yeah

she was on area tinker so ever and you

text:would recognize a lot from what basnight
TV you know can't you remember light is
like yeah luckily I doesn't celebrity
squares and blanket and they got
celebrities on and bombed them up and
deadlines on them and it's all so the

name:Michael McIntyre

text:same thing and there the comedy was
observational largely you get that now
with McIntyre John Besh it but whoever
that's not to see any of those are bad
shows it's just like you could do that
without having gone through alternative

name:Michael McIntyre

text:comedy which was you know iPhone dummy

Who would like to play Send To All?
Michael!

name:Michael McIntyre

text:This is awkward.
Brilliant!
Whoa!
It's Alesha's phone,
ladies and gentlemen.
No!
Oh, my God.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Don't! No, no!
Oh, my God!
What's great about Send To All is,
you don't know where the comedy
is going to come from.
I've got your blower.
In fact, Danny Dyer said it to me.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:I went to see Danny Dyer
before the show to say thank you
so much for doing this, don't worry,
all the rest of it,
and he looked at me and went,
"Right, it's not about me,
"it's about the blower."
Photos maybe, a few photos
on here? Yeah,
I've got a few smudges
in there, yeah.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:There's some funny photos already.
What's this?
I turned 40 this year
and I thought I need to start
growing up a little bit and
so I thought I'd get into gardening.
Anyway, as I bent down, that, right,
done me right in the eyeball.
Have you got a picture of it?
Is it on the phone?
Yeah, look at the state of me eye.
Oh, my!

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Oh, that is so fun.
So this is the result
of your attempt at gardening.
Terrible, I had to go to work
and tell them,
a week I was out of the game, Mike.
But were people in the week,
were they saying,
"Oi, Danny, had bit of a tear-up?"

name:Michael McIntyre

text:And you were going, "No,
I've taken up 'orticulture, mate."
But it's great fun to see people's
apps and little things
that you don't know is going
to be funny and insightful
end up being that,
like Alan Shearer's alarms.
These are your alarms. Oh...
What? I don't...

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Alan, are you a narcoleptic?
The best one undoubtedly
was Olly Murs's Uber,
because it was just so spontaneous.
Uber. Get me out of here!
I've never used it before.
Is it good? I don't know.
This is your last journey.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Did you have a nice trip?
It was lovely, thank you, yeah.
Not according to that rating.
I'd never used it before,
and realising
I can order a car here,
so we ordered this luxury car
and I had kind of forgotten about it
and he had arrived
at the theatre, the production team
had met him and said,

name:Michael McIntyre

text:"Look, do you mind
being on this TV show?"
They put a microphone on him.
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING
Ladies and gentlemen, it's Ionut!
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING
Our UNEXPECTED Unexpected
Star of the Show!

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Ionut, am I saying that right?
Ionut? Yes.
So, listen, do you like music?
Of course. Do you like pop music?
Everything.
If I was to say...
# Dear darling...
# Please excuse my writing

name:Michael McIntyre

text:# I can't stop my hands
from shaking... #
Does that ring any bells with you?
No.
How much do I owe you for
the trip to Basildon? Around 200.
AUDIENCE GASPS
Have you got a credit card,
or something?

name:Michael McIntyre

text:It has already been
charged to me anyway.
Oh, does it already get charged?
Yeah.
Does that already get
charged automatically? Yes.
But, of course, Send To All is all
about the texts we send
to their contacts.
The message I'm going
to send into your phone.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:VOICEOVER: My first ever celebrity
Send To All was Spice Girl,
Geri Horner.
Right. So let's just remind
ourselves what the text was.
Oh, my God. There's a classic.
Farmer Clive.
Oh, my God!

name:Michael McIntyre

text:I'm assuming he is a farmer.
Yeah. How do you know Farmer Clive?
Because I was at this party. Yes.
And...in the country,
and I was going to surprise
my husband and buy him some sheep.
As you do. As you do! When you're
an international pop star. Yeah.
Surprise him with some sheep.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:So, we got chatting so
I took his number. Oh, no!
So he thinks I want to massage...
So, you've only met him once
and it was about the possible
purchase of some sheep. Yeah.
He's a farmer, he's called Clive
and he's in your phone.
"I'm permanently in the
lambing shed at the moment,
"so it would have to be on
a straw bale."

name:Michael McIntyre

text:LAUGHTER
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
I sent a text to Bradley Walsh's
contacts
saying he'd had a crazy
dream about them.
Matt Up Yard? What's Matt Up Yard?
Who's that? That is...

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Who's Matt Up Yard?
It's just Matt up the yard.
He lives at the end of your garden?
Matt Up Yard. It's just... It's
just... It's just Matt up the yard.
Which yard? It is just a yard.
A yard,
where there's, like,
workshops and stuff.
Right, yeah. Like a mechanic yard.
Yeah, but he wraps cars.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:He's a rapper? I don't mean, like,
he raps cars, he wraps cars.
OK. Matt.
So, Matt Up Yard -
"Seriously? It probably means that
you need
"to have a moment to ground yourself
and get some quiet time.
"Try a bit of meditation.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:"Let me know if you need help
with that."
On the side, Matt does
all the crystals and stuff.
He does crystals and cars?!
Matt Up Yard... Matt Up Yard.
..does meditation and he fixes cars.
Is business not booming? Yeah.
I'm going to text him back.
Can you do Tuesday at two?

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Thank you very much. Here we go.
The text I sent from Holly
Willoughby's phone told everyone
they looked hideous the last time
she saw them.
Mr Hook? Oh, my God!
That's... That's my kids'
headmaster!
Mr Hook. He's gone with...

name:Michael McIntyre

text:"Are my suits really that bad?"
Oh, no!
Oh, my God, no! Oh, no!
Quick text back - yes. See you
tomorrow. No! Don't you dare!
Don't you dare! Don't you dare!
Oh, my God!

name:Michael McIntyre

text:I'm so sorry, Mr Hook.
Hannah Peckham?
Oh, she's my old school friend.
Hannah Peckham.
Yeah, we went to school together.
"The last time I saw you
was my wedding day.
"Bit harsh, Hol."
With Jamie Oliver, I sent two texts.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:First text was...
So that was sent off.
And I think people started
responding to that one
before I even sent this one.
The second text.
So, Babyface. Who's Babyface?
Dexter Fletcher, the actor. Ah.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:What did he say?
"What's going on, J?"
He's gone, "Ah! Got you.
I knew it.
"Fine, I'll keep your secret,
"but you have to promise to come
over in the week
"and cook my nan a curry."
It is the funniest thing.
Alfie Deyes?

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Yeah, blogger, vlogger.
SOME CHEERS
Whoo! Alfie Deyes, people
know about Alfie Deyes. Yeah.
"On my way to deliver it to you.
"Wait. Only 12 nuggets?
"Last time you smashed 24."
And it's always fun
when big stars reply.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Russell C? Who's Russell C?
QUIETLY: Russell Crowe! Oh, God.
That's Russell Crowe.
Russell Crowe!
Gladiator?!
"My name is
Maximus Aurelius Maximus.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:"Father of a murdered son.
"Son to a murdered father.
"And I shall get my vengeance,
Ronan Keating."
I really didn't want him to respond.
Oh, nothing gets past Crowe.
"Ha-ha! Someone's got
your phone, mate."

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Thank God. Thank God!
Yes. I have his phone.
And my name...is Maximus.
Father of a murdered son. No!
Shall I send that? AUDIENCE: Yes!
Right, that's gone to Russell Crowe.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:But what's it really like to sit
in that Send To All box?
You forget how personal
your connection with your phone is.
We'd like you to pop your phone
into our little contraption here
and I will take it away from you.
Thank you so much. Ladies and
gentlemen, Alexander Armstrong.
What a wonderful sport.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:There's this contraption,
obviously, you've seen it.
It looks like a... It's a sort
of blue velvet bum
and in the sort of cleft of the bum,
you then put your phone.
POINTLESS COLUMN SOUND EFFECTS
Oh, look at that.
And I think there's a moment,
as you sort of let go of your phone

name:Michael McIntyre

text:and it goes down,
there's a sort of...
Ah. Ah.
Possibly the most awkward text
I've ever had to send.
How are you feeling
about that as a starter? Lovely.
You've got my tone of voice
absolutely there.
If it was me...I'd want to know.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:You...have...
..really bad breath.
Maximum mortification. Just... Eek!
Shall I send that? AUDIENCE: Yeah!
Well, that's gone!
And it's not until some
of them start replying,

name:Michael McIntyre

text:you think, "Oh, my God,
they got one as well."
Upholstery Jane.
No! Oh, no!
If it went to her, only then do
you start thinking,
"Oh, God, it must have gone to them,
gone to them
"and gone to them and gone to them."

name:Michael McIntyre

text:So what did she upholster for you?
Oh, she's done some chairs for us.
Lovely. Chairs? Yes.
"Xander. Probably the most awkward
text I've ever replied to,
"especially as I haven't spoken
to you for at least two years.
"Is that why you forgot
to pick up your chair?"
Lovely Jane Leadbetter.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Most wonderful...
What she can't do with a needle.
"Is that why you didn't
pick up your chair?"
For two years, she's been sitting
watching Pointless,
on the chair that you never
picked up, thinking,
"Why has Xander never
picked up this chair?"
She's currently sitting
at home doing that.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Charlotte Church is in.
"Is this a hoax?"
She's on to it, Churchy.
Yeah. That's not Charlotte Church.
That's actually someone called
Charlotte from the church.
We organise this big carol service
every year and Charlotte
is the person you absolutely...

name:Michael McIntyre

text:You know, you don't want to let
Charlotte down.
I am so sorry to assume that
that was Welsh songstress
Charlotte Church.
Of course, it's somebody called
Charlotte from the church.
I was still getting texts
from Charlotte Church.
I don't think any amount
of reassurance

name:Michael McIntyre

text:was going to put her mind at rest.
Please give it up for
the incredibly brave
Alexander Armstrong!
I mean, a number of people go,
"Ha-ha! Of course I knew,
"of course I knew,"
some people say.
And you think, "No, you didn't,

name:Michael McIntyre

text:"I've got your abusive reply right
here, thank you very much.
"What do you mean,
of course you knew?"
Ed Balls was on Strictly
and was obviously infamously
brilliant and hilarious.

I don't think I believed
that I was going to hand
over my phone until it happened.
There it is. OK.
NatWest bank.
I won't go into your bank right now.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Ocado. Quite middle class.
Shop on the fly.
Oh, yes, there is a delivery,
it's coming!
We've got some savings there,
very good.
More than you offered us
when you were Shadow Chancellor.
Charlie Bingham chicken korma.
I'm racking my brains thinking,
"What on earth did I order?"

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Fine green beans.
There wouldn't be any polenta,
but what happens if there
was two packs of doughnuts?
Two salmon skinless
mid-tail fillets.
Don't mind if I do.
Yvette's away. Cooking for one.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:I'll save the other one,
freeze it for tomorrow, yeah?
You're a cook,
aren't you, I can tell. Yes.
And I do the Ocado shopping every
week. Well, how brave, how brave.
That is the most middle-class
sentence I've ever heard.
I'm absolutely exhausted.
Do you know, I do the Ocado
shop online every week?

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Do you mind, Ed, if I have a little
look at your photos?
Because that is always a bit of fun.
AUDIENCE: Ooh!
Oh, OK.
Has your shirt split open?
I should have edited these photos,
really. Yeah, that's...

name:Michael McIntyre

text:I was on It Takes Two and they said
that you shouldn't wear a jacket,
you should come in leisurewear.
I'd never worn smart casual before.
I bought a shirt,
which in retrospect was a mistake,
because it turned out
to be what's called tailored fit,
which was totally bursting
and looked absolutely terrible

name:Michael McIntyre

text:and then the wardrobe person ran on
with a pair of scissors
and cut my shirt all the way up
the back, to relax my front,
which, from behind,
was quite exposed.
Most people call it too small,
but you have opted for
"tailored fit". No, no...
I was embarrassed when Michael found
that photo, but relieved

name:Michael McIntyre

text:because I think there were quite
a lot worse in there.
That is...
I... I...
I'm sorry, the audience is having
so much fun,
we might sit on this for a while.
On that one, you can zone in a bit.
Sure, I wouldn't mind that at all.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:I think that's exactly
what the viewers want.
In fact, I forgot we could zoom in.
I'm going to go back
to the other one. No, no, no, no...
Come on, we might as well
have some fun.
No, no, I'm kidding.
You told me to zoom in!
That is good.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Those tracksuit bottoms are,
shall we say...
Shall we say "tailored fit"?
I think at that point
I just thought,
goodness knows what's going
to happen in the next hour,
but I might as well
just sit back and enjoy it.
So the text I am going to send
in Ed Balls's phone is as follows.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:"Just had a new hot tub delivered.
"Yvette's at the party conference."
LAUGHTER
No, don't go there. It's not there.
Trust me, you'll like it.
"So I'm having...

name:Michael McIntyre

text:"..a party of my own.
"Anton du Beke is here.
"Delia is doing canapes.
"And Stormzy is coming."
A hot tub with Delia Smith
and Anton du Beke and Stormzy?
That was a surprise to me.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Grab your swimsuit
and get down here,
"Gangnam Style."
That has...
..gone!
When you finally hit send to all,
my first feeling was relief.
At least he's not going to put
anything more

name:Michael McIntyre

text:into this text message.
It's party time at Ballsy's house!
Whoohoo!
Hundreds of people
were about to be invited by me
to a hot tub party.
What's Tony Blair
and Gordon Brown going to think?!

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Jeremy Vine from BBC Radio 2.
He has just opened with, "Blimey.
"Is Delia in the hot tub?
"I'm finding my leopard-print
swimming shorts..." in capitals,
"..RIGHT NOW."
People think I'm actually inviting
them to a hot tub party.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Who's Charlie K?
Charlie K is a councillor
in Wakefield.
So he's northern, Charlie K.
Yeah. Charlie.
"I would love to, but just
got back from Zakynthos,
"so me and Gracie are
a bit travel weary.
"We'll ring you in the week.
Take care. Thanks for the invite."

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Dude, did you read the text?
"We're a bit weary."
We're in a hot tub with Delia
and Stormzy and Anton du Beke!
"Yeah, but as I said, I'm a bit
travel weary from my trip."
June Cooper?
Is my mother-in-law.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:At that moment, I realised
things could get quite bad.
Your mother-in-law has texted,
"Your father-in-law is coming
if Katya is there."
Dwayne Grucock.
Oh, Dwayne Grucock is the person
who used to live next door to us.
He's a Methodist vicar.
He's a Methodist vicar?

name:Michael McIntyre

text:I got to tell you. It's really good.
"I'll just finish writing my sermon,
"then grab my towel."
I think what people don't realise
is that, even after the show,
the texts keep coming through from
people who know it's a joke
or from people who are actually
taking it seriously

and trunks for the hot tub party
and were really disappointed
that we weren't there

time which is very very rare which is

pillow duvet comes in it's it's the
perfect sleeping position because during

I see how the perfect position
dismantles cuz I'm watching the telly my
wife says goodnight she goes to sleep in
a perfect position we didn't moment the
legs the leg comes out here the mouth

name:Michael McIntyre

text:sort of flops over
[Music]
the arms up there
reason on me even though I've seen her
brushing her teeth ten fifteen minutes
over who's already slightly on the turn

name:Michael McIntyre

text:I'm wedging pillows in front of her face
does that weird jolting thing but nobody
quite knows what it is just wake us up
all right darling that was - I thought
it was falling you're not falling
darling if anything you're too much on

name:Michael McIntyre

text:my side you should be close

off she goes into a perfect position but
then within moments she drops off the
leg comes back and mumbling as well I
don't know who she's talking to

name:Michael McIntyre

text:she's mumbles in her sleep it's not your
language not English with herself in
tongues I know
sometimes her eyes pop open in my face
it's like a horror movie oh darling
the only time she smiles sweetly and I

name:Michael McIntyre

text:regret saying this is when the night
farts kick in proper person and she
hasn't actually farted in the daytime in
the 17 years we've been together and
it's a record we're both very proud of
her night record is not nearly as strong

name:Michael McIntyre

test me when I'm watching telly and she
reacts to them as well she dated the

what's that Michael there was a bang

name:Michael McIntyre

text:that was the bang everything's fine
seriously what was that oh my god why is
the window open what's been going on
here bang Michael on the floor why are
you holding the Febreze within moment
the legs

name:Michael McIntyre

text:So, here we go.
You've probably all been
in this situation before.
There's always a little trouble
as to find which is your seat belt.
Various seat belts.
Then I normally have
to go all the way.
I don't know about you.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:I will take this
to its absolute maximum.
Give me a little bit of room.
That pops in there,
nice and relaxed.
And then rude people,
as soon as the sign's off,
they will immediately recline.
You know who you are.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:As soon as the sign's off,
they will just go,
"Right, that's me."
But just so you know,
the person sitting behind you is
staring at the back of your head,
complaining to the whole row,
"Look at this guy,
look at this rude recliner."
Because the more polite of us -
and you also know who you are

name:Michael McIntyre

text:and I count myself among them -
you do it in increments.
Just every sort of ten minutes,
slowly, just a little bit...
And then there you are,
after 40 to 50 minutes,
they're behind you going,
"How the hell did you do that?"
Yes, that's the idea,
slow incremental reclining.
Then you've got your blanket,
if it gets chilly,

name:Michael McIntyre

text:shoes tend to go off.
Always a little bit embarrassing.
So, they always say, "Leave your
seat belt on," don't they?
They say, "Leave it on
in case of turbulence,"
so you have to leave your seat belt
on, then the blanket goes there,
then you try and sleep,
but then sometimes the stewardess...
There's turbulence,
the stewardess comes around,

name:Michael McIntyre

text:she says, "Excuse me, sir,
is your seat belt on?"
And it's a very awkward moment
when you have to lift
and direct her...
"Yes."
A very awkward moment
I'm sure we've all been through.
So, you've got all the things here,
the armrests move,

name:Michael McIntyre

text:the tray comes down,
we've even got food here,
which we can go through,
which is absolutely revolting.
The hardest...
The hardest bread you will ever get
in the world.
And then, of course,
they come down and go,
"Would you like the
chicken or the fish?

name:Michael McIntyre

text:"Chicken or the fish, sir?
We've got chicken or fish."
Then you go, "Oh, I think
I'll have the chicken."
They go, "We're out of chicken."
"All right.
Thanks for offering the chicken."
So, as you all know, for takeoff,
they always tell you to put
the blind up.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Sometimes you're about to take off,
everything's fine,
and they go, "Excuse me, sir.
Could you just pop your blind up?
"We need all the blinds up
for takeoff." Really?
This blind is linked
to the engine of the plane, is it?
Is the captain up there going,
"Something seems to be wrong,
"have you checked all the blinds?
Have you checked all the blinds?

name:Michael McIntyre

text:"32B, check with 32B.
"Whoa, that's better!
"Close one!"
All right.
So, this is where he'll come...
Ah, seat belt's on.
That's another thing that happens.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:When it ends, when the plane...
Because it's a race, isn't it,
to get off the plane? It's a race.
You pretend you're not racing,
don't you?
You look around, as soon as
you get there, looking around.
They always go, "Welcome to such and
such. We've arrived.
"Please wait for the
seat belt sign to go off."

name:Michael McIntyre

text:But everybody is waiting.
They might as well say,
"On your marks, get set...
"go!"
OK, now, ladies and gentlemen,
what is more important
on Christmas Day itself than lunch?

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Personally, huge fan.
Who loves a Christmas lunch,
by way of applause?
Who could not?
But of course,
it needs to be prepared,
so can I ask, by way of applause,
who cooks Christmas lunch?
Anyone in this room
who handles the cooking?

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Cooking?
All right.
I'm going to come down,
if you don't mind,
and have a little chat
with the Christmas cooks.
We've got one over here.
Hello, darling, nice to meet you.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:What's your name? Maria.
Hi, Maria. So you cook at Christmas?
I do. Tell me how it goes.
When do you start it? Christmas Eve.
Christmas Eve?
Turkey goes in overnight.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:I give it a good burst of 200
for an hour,
and then take it right down to 50
overnight.
Take it down overnight!
I'm going to take it down to 50!
Well, good luck this Christmas,
good luck.
Home cooks, anybody else cook?

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Cooks?

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Me! You, the home cook!
Yay! So you cook a lot at home?
Yes, all the time, I love it.
Freezing, do any freezing,

and serve it straight away.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Yes. How many freezers
have you got at home?
Two.
Two. Well, there you go,

And where is your home?

CHEERING

text:Margaret!
I know about your home, Margaret,
and I know about your two freezers,
because I've actually...
I've been in your home, Margaret.
Yes, you've looked
at your husband, David, there.
Hi, David, how are you?

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Nice to see you.
So, David of course, gave...
David gave me the keys
to the front door,
and I've been in your home,
Margaret. You haven't!

Here we are, Margaret.
It's your beautiful home in York!
OK, so, this is your hallway,
your lovely, beautiful family,
so let's go into your kitchen.
Oh, it's a lovely-sized kitchen.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Nice French table over there
in the conservatory.
Where are we eating?
Are we eating posh
or are we eating in the
kitchen? Who knows?
Let's head on through
to this room over here.
Into the freezer we go.
I am so excited about what you do,
Margaret. You are just a brilliant

name:Michael McIntyre

text:home cook, and you've got
everything covered.
You've got this freezer
full of amazing frozen dishes
that you've prepared,
and another freezer over here
full of food!
Gravy.
They've all got dates on it.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:This is your beef...
Beef cheeks.
And we're going to put it...
Have you been taking my food?
LAUGHTER
Chicken curry, mild.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Fish pie with the date on it.
Thank you very much, Margaret!
And now I've got a long way
to get back to London.
Thank you, Margaret.
You're obviously a little bit
confused now in the theatre,
wondering what on earth
I'm going to do with all this food.
Well, let's find out.
Bye, Margaret!

name:Michael McIntyre

text:# Ice ice baby... #
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING
Margaret, Margaret,
I took all your food.
What were you saying to me?
You couldn't believe it.
I've stolen your food,
haven't I, Margaret?
That's terrible!

name:Michael McIntyre

text:It IS terrible,
but why have I done that?
I'm wondering whether you've
recently been out for any special
meals with David.
Yes. You have?
Where did you go?
I went to Michael Roux's
restaurant, Le Gavroche.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Michel Roux Jr? Michel Roux Jr. His
two-star, Michelin star, restaurant,
Le Gavroche. Le Gavroche.
What you don't know, Margaret,
is Michel was with his friend,
me, that night. Really?
Not only that, Margaret -
do you know what we did
with your food?

name:Michael McIntyre

text:We reheated it
and we served it back to you.
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE
You cheeky...!
Let's take a look at what happened.
FRENCH ACCORDION MUSIC PLAYS

name:Michael McIntyre

text:OK. Bonjour. Bonjour, chef. Ca va?
So, this is Michel Roux Jr,
one of the world's greatest chefs.
I am Michel McIntyre senior.
Have you heard of the home cook
Margaret Brown?
Nope.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Well, I've been to her house
in York, and have stolen a few
dishes from her freezer.
So, this is a mild chicken korma.
Oh, this is important - beef cheeks.
It looks really soft and tender.
Just needs a bit more sauce.
Yeah, well, this is key to this,
Michel.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:We're not going to add anything.
We're serving all her food
back to her.
The only thing we're focusing on
is presentation.
So I can pimp them up a bit?
Oh, completely, you've got
to give her the full Roux.
The fish pie, fish pie, Michel.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Fish pie all over my shoes.
Sorry, Chef! Sorry, Chef.
So, now it's time
for Michel Roux Jr
to heat up all of Margaret's
defrosted food,
and serve it straight back to her
in his
two-Michelin-starred restaurant.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:# Hey-hey, good-lookin'
# What you got cooking?
# How's about cooking something up
with me... #
OK, they're here!
May I take the name you booked
under, please? Brown.
Brown. There you are.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:We're off, we're off, we're off,
it's happening.
And, sir. Thank you very much.
Just so you know, tonight
you're going to be trying
a taster menu for Le Gavroche.
So if you could let us know
your honest feedback at the end
of every course,
we'd love to get your real opinions

name:Michael McIntyre

text:on how the food tastes.
Enjoy your meal.
This is our menu. This is made
entirely from Margaret's food.
Up first, we have vegetable soup,
which was found in her freezer,
and this is now
Cappuccino de Legume.
So, we're going to froth it up,
make it lovely and light and fluffy

name:Michael McIntyre

text:and serve it in a beautiful
demitasse, something that looks
very fancy and upmarket.
Fantastic.
Just a little...
Oh, yes.
Aw! Magnifique.
So, Margaret's frozen vegetable soup
has been heated up and given a posh
French name, Cappuccino de Legume.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Thank you. Monsieur, bon appetit.
Thank you.
Then we move on to the Parmentier de
Poissons, Bisque de Crevettes,
which means fish pie. Basically,
fish pie to you and me.
So, that's her fish pie and
you've taken off the potatoes,
and you've squirted it
back on the top.
Piped it back on,
but it's all her mash,

name:Michael McIntyre

text:all her filling, everything.
Amazing.
THEY LAUGH
Service. On y va.
So, Margaret's frozen fish pie
has been heated up and renamed...
Hmm...
Sensual.
What did you do to that fish pie?

name:Michael McIntyre

text:I told you not to add anything.
Not me, bruv.
She's leaving her own peas!
She shouldn't have put them
in if she didn't like the peas.
I don't know, Margaret, why you put
peas in it
if you don't want the peas.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Who would do that?
Now, I'm really excited
about the next course
because we've had two
very average reviews so far.
The beef. I would sit down and eat
it no problem at all.
I think it's lovely.
That's looking very good.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:I'm very impressed
with these shallots.
They've been beautifully cooked.
Beautifully cooked, Margaret.
That's coming from Michel Roux.
There we go.
You have Michelined Margaret.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:So, Margaret's frozen beef cheeks
with carrots is now presented as...
This is for you. Thank you.
We don't know what this is exactly.
It's pretty nondescript,
but kind of chicken flavour.
I think we should serve it with,
actually, the korma.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:I'll reduce this down and...
And you're going to call it...?
Le Jus du Congel.
Which is roughly translated as?
The juice from the freezer.
LAUGHTER

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Food sounds so much better
in French.
Le Jus du Congel.
I think she's going to love it.
A nice bit of sauce.
Margaret's frozen chicken korma is
now...
Le Jus du Congel.
LAUGHTER

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Thank you.
Thank you.
LAUGHTER
So, we found this chutney
in her freezer and we've just...
Mashed it up.
And you've decided to pop it on
your favourite thing.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:I think it's a great sponge.
This will come with a coffee,
but we don't know if it works
together cos you've not tried it,
but you're confident.
Yes. All right, well, Margaret,
it's your chutney and
it's your sponge.
You didn't intend them to go
together, but Michel Roux

name:Michael McIntyre

text:has decided it will work, and,
well, you be the judge.
Service.
So, Margaret's frozen sponge
and chutney
have been united to make...
Is that all right?
That's lovely. Thank you.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Mm.
Oh, there he is! Good evening!
Good to see you. Good evening.
You've got a big smile on your face.
That's normally a good sign. Good.
Enjoyed it all?

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Any kind of negative, positives
that I should know about?
Cos I want honest feedback.
It didn't do it for you?
You didn't like it?
Tasted bland?
The soup?

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Do you think yours at home is
better?
Pleasure. Great to have you here.
It's good to be here. Thank you.
So, Margaret, that was amazing.
Thank you, Michel.
Sensational.
It has been fun. One day, Margaret,

name:Michael McIntyre

text:you'll get to try Michel's
ACTUAL cooking.
All right, come on, let's go.
Not so fast. What?
Washing-up to do.
Oh, for goodness' sake!
CHEERING
Oh, Margaret.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Margaret, ladies and gentlemen!
That must absolutely blow your mind.
You had no idea, Margaret.
Did you really come
and steal my food?
Yes, Margaret, you saw me
in your house.
I came up to York, David let me in,
I had a lovely cup of tea,

name:Michael McIntyre

text:I actually had some cake
in your fridge.
David, by the way,
deserves a round of applause,
ladies and gentlemen.
CHEERING
David was absolutely amazing.
David!
It's been really hard to keep
the secret. Really, it has.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Because what David had to do,
of course, Margaret,
is he had to get you talking about
your food,
to review it, and at one point,
you might remember,
you had a row about the peas.
David kept saying,
"Why don't you like the peas?
"Why don't you like the peas?"

name:Michael McIntyre

text:And you went, "Will you just
shut up about the peas?!"
So why did you put peas in your
fish pie if you don't want peas
in the fish pie?
Well, it's to tempt the
grandchildren to eat vegetables.
Oh, you're the sweetest,
loveliest person, Margaret.
So I don't think you can quite come
to terms yet that this actually

name:Michael McIntyre

text:happened, so why don't we welcome
into the theatre,
Michel. No! Michel Roux,
ladies and gentlemen.
CHEERING
Well, I've got to taste YOUR food,
then! Well, that's...
Funny you should say that.
Funny you should say that.
We have a lovely prize for you,
Margaret. Michel...

name:Michael McIntyre

text:On behalf of the Big Show,
we would love to have you back,
but this time, I promise
I'll be cooking my food.
That's just for you.
CHEERING
Margaret, we've also got you
this book.
It is From Freezer To Fabulous.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:It's a cookbook.
It's what I stole from your freezer,
and you've got some quotes
here about your own vegetable soup -
"6 out of 10, lacked flavour,
"but enjoyable."
Maybe you can put that
on top of the freezer
when David wants
to make himself a meal.

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Margaret, you've been the loveliest,
sweetest lady.
I've been dying to meet you.
Big hand for David, her husband, for
helping us set the whole thing up.
The extraordinary Michel Roux.

And my favourite home-cook
in the world, it's Margaret!

but for the children it's good it's
dangerous for them to be so hot so
you've got to get them in the shade it's

name:Michael McIntyre

text:important this involves umbrellas right
because the Sun hits the umbrellas then
it cast a shadow and that's the shade
you've got to get the children into that
shadow but it's quite difficult yet to
work with the positioning so my children

name:Michael McIntyre

text:will be like on a Sun bed here the
umbrella is there the Sun is there the
shadows are in the pool so I have to
move it with my wife's they just moved
and bitumen seems easy doesn't it but
they're very heavy they're the heaviest

name:Michael McIntyre

text:umbrellas the only way to move them is
you have to tilt it and twirl it even
don't where you start it and then twirl
it the other way how you're supposed to
reach your destination
exactly how I'm supposed to get over

name:Michael McIntyre

text:there watch that were you going I'm
trying desperately to get over you go

you've been away somewhere nice and your
socks but the spray tan is good as you

they spray her like a very dark mahogany

name:Michael McIntyre

text:I saw a color that no human being has
ever been right and then she have to
wait like 24 hours and then you wash off
the mahogany and this is a beautiful
golden brown color but this 24 hour
period well it's difficult it's

is that she sinks as well she's a little
stinky mahogany blow-dried woman walking

you know we're deliriously happy and
there are people in here in long-term
relationships there are people in New
Malaysian ships there are people not in
relationships I suppose the question I'm

name:Michael McIntyre

text:asking is how do you know you're in a
long-term relationship how do you know
you can start terming your relationship
as long-term well I think if you're
interested I've actually pinpointed the
exact moment when a relationship goes

name:Michael McIntyre

text:long-term I think it's when before sex
you no longer take each others clothes
off but you take your own clothes off
independently because you realize it's
more practical and less time-consuming
there's in a new relationship up as your

name:Michael McIntyre

text:films with romance and passion lots of
fiddling with brass straps and belts and
ripping and then one night you don't
even discuss it you'll just find
yourself independently lying adjacent to
one another and slowly obviously once

name:Michael McIntyre

text:you've established sex is on that's not
me just a sort of hopeful look towards
her
or she'll be something sensationally
erupted like mute to the television can
only be one thing

name:Michael McIntyre

text:[Applause]
slowly take your clothes off she'll be
there do-seong obviously if it's a
special occasion
confirm your bills entirely naked right
let's begin and it's the same for

name:Michael McIntyre

text:afterwards as well you know in a new
relationship after sex you were main
naked for some period of time into a new
relationship everything so new my new
relationship with my chili balls in my
new relationship in a long-term

name:Michael McIntyre

trick couples do it somebody could come

name:Michael McIntyre

text:into a room survey the scene walk out
for three maybe three-and-a-half minutes
wall back in but you have to be careful

text:take them for granted and often you know
she'll never work Safina Michael you've

my children at the moment a game that
I'm immensely proud of because they're

name:Michael McIntyre

text:loving it and I invented it I'm the
inventor of this game it's called pants
down you're the loser
know the rules of the game a much like
the title suggests
I basically chase my children around the

name:Michael McIntyre

text:house and if I manage to pull their
pants down they are declared the loser
of the game but the real beauty in the
playing of this game we don't plan on it
it's not like I say hey this Sunday kids
squeeze in some pumps down none of that

name:Michael McIntyre

text:shit
anytime day or night I'll just go down
cross their arms away from me sit down
for dinner at the end of the day my wife
will be like you've got a good day
children I didn't watch in the middle of

sleeve you know I've been walking up the
stairs let's go behind them Pat's down

name:Michael McIntyre

text:back please don't think and this is very
important to me that I play this game to
the best of my ability I never actually

than any other supermarket I've never

the hot coca-cola please I'm having such

name:Michael McIntyre

hot coca-cola atmosphere of a football
hitting me in the head and of course
that's when the bees and the wasps start
to chip in the pure day because they
live outside okay so they'll start to

name:Michael McIntyre

text:come into your life and you'll deal with
the situation I believe as a British
person in one of three ways you'll
recognise yourself in this as we go
through it when it be all wasp buzzes
into your life either you are firstly a

name:Michael McIntyre

text:wafter okay you'll know who you are it's
called the wafters they're quite cool by
the way throw it what get quite cool yes
you just deal with the situation okay
off you go sure sometimes you don't even
break stride in your conversations so

name:Michael McIntyre

text:the other day we were you just dealt
with the situation I'm just gonna move
the air news
this is an area where you're
particularly welcome
right next up secondly you have the

name:Michael McIntyre

text:space tillers now they are very serious
people that their strategy is the best
one to deal with the situation okay you
only move just stay completely still
don't make it angry they get quite angry
with the waters don't want it

name:Michael McIntyre

text:Shangri you're encouraging it don't
encourage it interested in us and we're
not interested in see it's gone now
just stay completely still and it'll get
about its business okay then the third
way the total panic Asst

name:Michael McIntyre

text:[Applause]
did you see those matches oh my god
you know to get you on the third you can
die
[Applause]
that's the third way thou wafters are

name:Michael McIntyre

text:able to upgrade and become the total
pentakus they allow themselves that
privilege if things if they're wafting
is ineffective and the wasp keeps coming
back then you can see them start to
panic

name:Michael McIntyre

text:which is why wafters really hardly ever
gets them and total panic is almost
never gets done you know who gets done
the stay still is because they cannot
break out of their seriousness they are
such firm believers that they hunt the

name:Michael McIntyre

text:right strategy and this is why I sought
service I've got a friend he's a stay
Stiller and a wasp now if anybody around
him but landed on his face the best
thing to do sure about that it's on your
face I don't want to encourage it you're

name:Michael McIntyre

text:just encouraging it to crawl into your
eyes he's like no the best things it's
not interested in me
he's pretty interested in you
whether you offed it the worst thing I
can do is waft it just stay completely

name:Michael McIntyre

text:still on the other side of his face oh
my dude you don't have to what's on your
face I put it one of the funniest things
I've ever seen

up that he was sitting there right

text:ground balls to second base but of all
the awards Tina has received of all the
Emmys of all the Golden Globes of all
the Mark Twain's of all the writers
guilds of all the people's choices I
know that this is the most special for

name:Tina fey

text:Tina because this award also comes with
breakfast - she loves British loves
breakfast I have had the pleasure of
working with Tina
on many occasions she has cast me as an
extremely stupid doctor on 30 rock

name:Tina fey

text:she is cast me as an extremely creepy
psychopath on unbreakable kimmy schmitt
and now actually saying out loud I
realized maybe Tina not might not have
the highest opinion of me but Tina the
joke is on you because the feeling is

name:Tina fey

text:not mutual I happen to think that
working together was the beginning of a
friendship that I sincerely treasure so
highroad
Tina's resume is flat-out intimidating
even before you take into account the

name:Tina fey

text:fact that she is only 46 years old I'm
sorry I read that wrong only 4 to 6
years old
dur than me just also not true she has
written a number one best-selling book
she has created two television shows she

name:Tina fey

text:has created a hit movie and she's now
working on a Broadway musical but most
impressive impressive to me is that Tina
is a role model for young women across
the country and in this room inspiring
most of them to throw away their

name:Tina fey

classes congratulations Tina a grateful

have played a linguist Michelle I could
have played a linguist but it's not all

around brett ratner is here

name:Tina fey

text:thing where you could eat breakfast off

Chuck Lorre is here seeing Chuck here is
a great reminder that while we're
focused on women today we are a

like something that I would have poured
over a picture of an InStyle magazine

name:Tina fey

text:you know 20 years ago living in Chicago
standing in a Walgreens and then I would
have put the InStyle back and I would
have used that money to buy pudding but
it is a really a dream come true to be
here with you today I want to say thank

name:Tina fey

text:you to Steven Galloway from The
Hollywood Reporter for starting this Big
Sisters of LA partnership
what a what a brilliant idea that
continues to be and I would love to talk
to you later about how we could do this

name:Tina fey

text:in New York and how we could start this
in New York
I want to congratulate our other
speakers today Megan Kelly Megan and I
don't know each other but we did once
take the same plane to Disney World with

name:Tina fey

text:our children so I feel like we've served
in the Marines together Ryan Murphy the
prolific genius who has created so many
wonderful opportunities for actresses of
a certain age to play witches and
horrifying monsters and lawyers who fail

name:Tina fey

text:to convict yeah I'm just I'm kidding I'm
some I'm with Michelle Bowen WME lavell
I'm what they call tech avail I want to
thank I want to thank my friend Jon Hamm
for being here today showing up to an
event like this jon is literally putting

name:Tina fey

text:himself in danger
quick story about jon hamm this is not
the first time he has helped me out by
showing up to hand me an award John and
I hadn't known each other long in 2009
when he kindly agreed to come to

name:Tina fey

text:Washington DC to help present me the
Mark Twain prize for American humor I'm
just mentioning the Mark Twain prize to
try to keep Ryan Murphy humble is it
seem like it's working anyway uh John
came all the way to DC to help give me

name:Tina fey

text:that award and my whole family was there
and it was a very special night and at
the party afterwards my cousin came up
to me and said um I just met Jon Hamm
and okay so handsome but you know I have
to say like I kind of like it better

name:Tina fey

text:when he's dressed like Don Draper and I
said yeah you know he actually doesn't
do it for me at all I'm kind of uh I
really like kind of like john slattery
is kind of more my deal at which point I
heard a little voice over my shoulder

name:Tina fey

text:say I can fucking hear you
and it was done
[Applause]
and yet here he is giving me another
award I don't know what to tell you
buddy I just you can keep showing up

name:Tina fey

text:with these things but I just don't like
you like that like you're embarrassing
yourself now I actually think that might
be the basin's basis for the longevity
of our French lip is that I am team
slats and you can't stand it

name:Tina fey

text:I love Slattery um anyway that'll be the
pullquote
and of course I want to sincerely thank
Sherry Lansing for allowing me to
tarnish her good name by receiving this
award sherry did

name:Tina fey

text:as we've said gave me my first big break
in the movies when I was a writer
Saturday Night Live and I came and said
I wanted to write a movie about
relational aggression among girls and it
became Mean Girls and again I just

name:Tina fey

text:mentioned the title Mean Girls because
just want to remind Ryan Murphy that not
every gay thing is like popular because
of him
but going through that process of making
that movie with sherry it taught me so

name:Tina fey

text:much you know I had no idea what I was
doing I think I wrote ten drafts of the
script and and sherry never took it away
from me she never got nervous and had
someone else come in to do a two-week de
flavor izing of it and I didn't realize

name:Tina fey

text:at the time how special that was that I
do now and so I want to say thank you
sherry for that I do and I intend to use
sherry as an example for my two
daughters as they grow up because I
believe that sherry is living proof that

name:Tina fey

text:you can be thank you
you can be smart it's just water you can
be smart and powerful and in charge and
still comb your hair that's not
something I can't model for them at home
I don't comb my hair also you know think

name:Tina fey

text:about sherry hold on just a long
ventriloquist water tape the thing about
sherry is she built this whole career
for herself without a sex tape like God
God bless or who even does that anymore
sherry even I got my start by getting

name:Tina fey

text:rolled bottomless out of a limo in front
of the ivy by Joe Francis I got famous
but first people don't remember that but
it's true and I'm not ashamed of it
because Here I am now anyway what an
amazing year it's been for women

name:Tina fey

text:[Applause]
what are you here for women hey
seriously I haven't I talked about this
in the magazine I realize that came out
today but I've been thinking a lot over
the past couple months like how can we

name:Tina fey

text:proceed with dignity in this
increasingly ugly misogynistic time and
it occurred to me that sherry is the
perfect role model because talk about
someone who remained graceful and
effective in what must have been an

name:Tina fey

text:incredibly misogynistic environment I
mean she's much too refined to ever say
but you know Sherry Lansing has
witnessed some nonsense and some
behavior that the young people today
would call triggering and yet she was

name:Tina fey

text:able to flourish and lead with all of
her humanity and her femaleness intact
and maybe that can be the mantra we all
take with us the next four years what
would Sherry Lansing do right what would
Sherry Lansing - Steven Galloway when

name:Tina fey

text:does your book come out cuz I need to
know how sherry did all this shit Steven
Galloway wrote a book about sherry we
need to read it all reading phenol how
do we do this and you know I promised
myself I wouldn't get up here today and

name:Tina fey

text:talk about the election because when I
get written up in Breitbart I want it to
be because they're mad that I'm making
an all female Hitler biopic
but I have to say that I think the real
reason that Hillary lost and it's the

name:Tina fey

text:thing that people are afraid to talk
about not enough celebrity music videos
urging people to vote I mean I hate to
be that person guys I just think if
there had been like one more funny rap
or like another Hamilton parody or

name:Tina fey

text:something just like a little more hustle
from Liz banks and we could have took
Michigan I bring it up actually because
the structure of those celebrity
get-out-the-vote videos always brings me
joy because you start first with the

name:Tina fey

text:dedicated people who agreed to show up
for like a full weekend at the studio
and then like record the whole thing and
film it and then by the second verse you
get the people who agreed to participate
from like the steps of their trailer

name:Tina fey

text:looking at you Jane Lynch and then and
then it always just ends with like Patti
LuPone singing one line from her
basement into a phone and I feel like
that's the career trajectory we all want
right it's like we're all just punching

name:Tina fey

text:the clock until we can be basement loop
homes just in the yeah I'm nailing it
I've been trying to think about what it
means to me to be a woman in Hollywood
and what my experience has been and I
think it's actually been pretty positive

name:Tina fey

text:I've worked with a lot of very evolved
men Lorne Michaels Robert Carlock my
husband Jeff Richmond
I've always been treated like a valued
peer in the writers room and I think
I've had a pretty solid acting career so

name:Tina fey

text:far for someone who is PBS pretty and
not suitable from behind
I dare you to watch any movie I'm in and
see if I ever walk away from camera no
ma'am not if I'm a producer on it but at
the same time you know I'm not immune to

name:Tina fey

text:the pressure to try to look better I was
at a lovely fancy dermatologists offices
recently one I'm sure many of you have
been to and um I asked the facialist I
said up
Suzanne what's the best like

name:Tina fey

text:non-invasive way to tighten your face
and she said in this like
french-canadian lilt that she has she's
like well I you know I think that would
probably be the othera anybody here had
all ferret know where this story is

name:Tina fey

text:headed and so I said yes I've heard of
that Suzanne I've heard of ofer I have
you tried it Suzanne and she said yes I
have yeah and I'm changing her name to
Suzanne for anonymity her name's really
Elena and I said you know I I hear that

name:Tina fey

text:the old Farrah really hurts though
Suzanne does it hurt and Suzanne said
well you know it's it sort of feels like
you're being um stabbed and electrocuted
at the same time
[Applause]

name:Tina fey

text:stabbed and electrocuted at the same
time and the moral of the story is I'm
still considering it guys that's what
it's like to be a woman in Hollywood and
then I try to think about what it means
to be powerful and and am i a powerful

name:Tina fey

text:woman and I think power means knowing
that you will be heard not necessarily
obeyed but heard it's knowing that you
literally won't be shouted down during
the conversation and I have a little bit
of that power I can get Bob Greenblatt

name:Tina fey

text:or Donna Langley on the phone within
like 48 hours but can I get my
five-year-old to answer me if Teen
Titans go is on no I cannot no I just
stand there holding socks like Penelope
Penelope Penelope but with Penelope is

name:Tina fey

text:it such an embarrassing name to say over
and over yourself like such a wuss I was
like having finality like I should have
named her like Rick like killer Jim put
your socks on like anyway if you don't
have a kid yet don't name it Penelope

name:Tina fey

text:I think power is having a job where
you're allowed to go to the restroom
whenever you want because I've had jobs
where you can't and I will never go back
power I think is having proven yourself
enough that people say yes to you when

name:Tina fey

text:maybe they don't want to when we pitched
NBC a comedy show about a woman who was
kidnapped at 13 and held captive for 15
years they didn't want a show
but they had to say yes cuz they were
already paying me and I believed in that

name:Tina fey

text:show and now that show is in its third
season somewhere else and maybe I think
maybe even more important than getting a
yes
I think power is having the freedom to
say no to something you don't want to do

name:Tina fey

text:whether it is writing a pilot for a bad
actor or the butter scene in Last Tango
in Paris or telling Roger Ailes to put
his hamburger meat back in the freezer
feeling like you can say no without any
negative repercussions is an important

name:Tina fey

text:kind of power and it's one that we can
help give each other I have that power
and I promise to help other women have
it too
and I'm lucky enough to have a great
support system my husband Jeff who I'm

name:Tina fey

text:officially have mentioned twice now my
wife Amanda Pete remember one of a game
of Thrones guy kept saying that the
enemies is my wife Amanda Pete I enjoyed
that um my friends you know I talked to
my SNL lady friends every day

name:Tina fey

text:Amy Maya Rachel Ana Paula Emily we talk
every day by text and it is such an
incredible support system you may notice
that I didn't invite any of them here
today that is how much I love them
because asking comedy ladies to get up

name:Tina fey

text:and put on a dress at eight o'clock in
the morning they would genuinely be
happier if I shit on their lawn but we
all talk every day and and what I'm
observing is we may not be quite as
thirsty as we used to be right we love

name:Tina fey

text:to work and we love to do good work but
we don't need approval in the same way
we're adults now and we know who we are
and what we're good at and I think we're
really starting to ask ourselves what is
next for me what what is my role in this

name:Tina fey

text:business going to be once nobody wants
to grab me by the pussy anymore and a
fourth first there's a lot of
reassurance that everyone's pussy is
still very grabbable know your business
immediately grab a bowl um but and there

name:Tina fey

text:was a little bit of loose talk of like
giving it all up and making pottery in
New Mexico but you know I know these
women and I think what's festering and
what we will see will be a new
generation of producers and some

name:Tina fey

text:directing and some mentoring of young
talent and maybe if we're lucky of
really successful Golden Girls reboot
with all of us
and so you know what are my goals as a
is a powerful women in Hollywood like

name:Tina fey

text:you I want to keep making things I want
to keep telling stories mostly about
women and girls I want them to be
positive stories I want to hire women
one of my proudest moments last year on
the set of Kimmy Schmidt was standing on

name:Tina fey

text:set for a scene that was Claire Scanlon
directing written by Meredith Scardino
produced by me the four mole women
staging a fight scene with Jill Brown
our female stunt coordinator and I saw
this is this is the best this is what I

name:Tina fey

text:want to keep putting into the world and
giving women jobs I would like to work
less that said I'm not going to lie to
you um my dream is to work three 12-hour
days in the middle of the week and
receive an award every six months I I

name:Tina fey

text:would like to talk less and at this
point I imagine you would like that too
my goal is to be like Beyonce and never
do interviews anymore right in every way
beyond Beyonce because people ask me a
lot of the same questions over and over

name:Tina fey

text:they asked me what advice do you have
for young women and I say don't smoke
wear a bra trust your instincts don't
fuck John Mayer they asked me how do you
balance work and family I say on your
mom's back that's how they asked me if

name:Tina fey

text:I'm proud of Amy Schumer and I say yes
I'm very proud of Amy Schumer they asked
me what do you say to people who say
that women aren't funny to which I say
it is time to stop talking about that
and start talking about how black people

name:Tina fey

text:are funnier than white people
thank you for this honor everyone gets
to work is the last
[Applause]

turn on the vacuum to drown out the
sound of her and my dad fighting which
is why I rarely vacuum my apartment like

little bit at a country steaks
all-you-can-eat buffet and I didn't
leave until I finished my second plate
of shrimp a couple of months ago I went
on a date with my cousin Wow I'm a mess

name:Tina fey

text:there is an 80% chance in the next
election that I will tell all my friends
I am voting for Barack Obama but I will
secretly vote for John McCain here's one
when I was a kid I used to put on my
fanciest nightgown and then I would mix

name:Tina fey

text:orange soda and cream soda in a
champagne glass and I would sit in the
dark and watch The Love Boat

fantasy stuff about Gopher from Love
Boat and I lied I have had five Donuts

name:Tina fey

text:today so that's my deal now ease
was you know the Roomba is a nice quiet
alternative to a vacuum thank you that's
a good tip and in the interest of full
disclosure I also have a sexual fantasy
about gopher except mine's the one from

because my style is so typically
Austrian
I never thought I would even qualify for
the Mark Twain prize for American humor

name:Tina fey

text:I mean maybe the Nathaniel Hawthorne
prize for judgmental nature the Judy
Blume award for awkward puberty or the
Harper Lee prize for small bodies of
work but never this and yet I hope that
like Mark Twain a hundred years from now

name:Tina fey

text:people will see my work and think wow
that is actually pretty racist
apparently I'm only the third woman ever
to receive this award and I'm so honored
to be numbered with Lily Tomlin and
Whoopi Goldberg but I do hope that that

name:Tina fey

text:women are achieving at a rate these days
that we can stop counting what number
they are at things yes I was like yeah
yes I was the first female head writer
at Saturday Night Live and yes I was
only the second woman ever to be

name:Tina fey

childhood or a troubled family so to my
family I say they're giving me the Mark
Twain prize for American humor what did
you animals do to me
I know my mother and father are so proud

name:Tina fey

text:of me tonight so this is probably a good
time to tell them I'm putting you both
in a home we'll talk about it later I
met my husband Jeff when we were both in
Chicago and I had short hair with a perm
on top and I would wear oversized denim

name:Tina fey

text:shorts overalls and that is how I know
our love is real at some point in the
future our daughter Alice will will find
a DVD of this broadcast or I don't know
download it into the subdermal
iPhone in her eyelids I don't know how

name:Tina fey

text:far in the future we're talking about
but I hope that it will make her laugh
and I hope it will explain to her why
her parents looked so tired all the time
the one person without whom I really
would not be here tonight

name:Tina fey

text:except of course my mother who is pretty
sure she delivered me even though she
had a lot of Twilight sleep the other
one person is Lorne Michaels in 1997 I
flew from Chicago to New York to have an
job interview for a writing position at

name:Tina fey

text:Saturday Night Live and I was hopeful
because I heard the show was looking to
diversify which oh by the way only in
comedy is a obedient white girl from the
suburbs and diversity candidate
but I remember you know I came from my

name:Tina fey

text:job interview and the only decent
clothes that I had at the time Lauren's
right was I had a pair of black pants
and a sweater from contempo casuals and
I went to the security guard at the
elevator at 30 Rockefeller Plaza and I

name:Tina fey

text:said I'm here to see Loren Michaels and
I couldn't believe the words that were
coming out of my mouth I'm here to see
Lorne Michaels and I went up to the 17th
floor and to have my meeting with Loren
and the only thing anyone had told me

name:Tina fey

text:about meeting with Loren having a job in
the interview they said whatever you do
do not finish his sentences a girl I
knew in Chicago had done that and she
felt like it had cost her the job and so
whatever you do don't finish his senses

name:Tina fey

text:and I was there and I really didn't want
to blow it and Loren said so you're from
and it just was hanging there so you're
from and fun that couldn't take any more
and I said Paisley I'm from Pennsylvania
a suburb of Philadelphia just as Lauren

name:Tina fey

text:finished his thought and said Chicago
and I thought that's it
I blew it and I don't remember anything
else about the meeting because I just
kept staring at him thinking this is the
guy from The Beatles check I can't

name:Tina fey

text:believe that I'm in his office and you
know I could have never have guessed
that a couple years later I would be
sitting in that office until 2:00 3:00
4:00 in the morning thinking if this
meeting doesn't end I'm going to kill

name:Tina fey

text:this Canadian bastard the last time that
I was in Washington was in 2004 to take
this life magazine cover photo with John
McCain and Senator McCain gave my
husband and me a tour of the Senate and
we all spent a lovely busy afternoon

name:Tina fey

text:together and I have it on good authority
that this picture of Senator McCain and
myself has been hanging in his office by
his desk since 2004 and he has been
looking at it every day since 2004
getting ideas

name:Tina fey

text:so guess what I'm saying is this whole
thing might be my fault
I would be a liar and an idiot if I
didn't thank Sarah Palin for helping get
me here tonight
my partial resemblance and her crazy

name:Tina fey

text:voice are the two luckiest things that
have ever happened to me I'm all kidding
aside I'm so proud to represent American
humor I am proud to be American I am
proud to make my home in the not real
America and I am most proud that even

name:Tina fey

text:during trying times like an orange alert
or a bad economy or a contentious
election that we as a nation retain our
sense of humor anyway I don't want to go
on and on because I know we still have
to talk about the other four nominees so

cultural shift, Tina Fey.

[indistinct chatter]
- Yes, "Playboy" magazine
has announced that they
will stop publishing naked
photos early next year.
Dashing the dreams of many
a beautiful young woman
who had hoped to one
day move to Los Angeles

name:Tina fey

text:and then, just by changing
every single aspect
of her appearance, maybe
become Miss February,
and then work her way
up the company ladder
until one day, she gets
invited to have an early bird
fake five-way with
a 100-year-old sex monster.
But you know what really
killed "Playboy," Colin?

text:The Internet.
The Internet cut
out the middleman.

man anymore to choose
which one of us gets to

independence.
Girls need to learn
coding and arm butts...

name:Tina fey

text:which isn't to say that
I'm not sentimental
about the end of
"Playboy" centerfolds.
There's always a certain
amount of nostalgia
when you come
to the end of an era,
and for me personally,
it means that my dream
of posing for "Playboy"
will never come true.

name:Tina fey

text:It's something I've dreamed of
since I was a little girl.
You know, I dreamed of
doing all the poses.
I was gonna do this one.
Yeah, and I was
gonna do this one,
in just a half an Eagles jersey
and tube socks.
And I was gonna do this
one on a bale of hay.

name:Tina fey

text:[cheers and applause]
- I don't know
if I know where to look.

>> [LAUGH]
>> I had a busy summer, we went to London.
Portia and I went to London.

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:It was a beautiful time to be there
because the weather was nice and
it was still part of Europe.
>> [LAUGH]
>> And we were there for the Finding Dory
premiere and the whole cast was there and
we walked the red carpet.
I got to put my hands in the cement in
front of the theater and the people,
the construction site,
boy they were so angry.

>> Fooled you!

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:>> [LAUGH]
>> My favorite thing that happened this
summer was we were invited to- Portia and
I were invited to- the White House for
the President's birthday party.
So we went to- no big deal.
>> [LAUGH]
>> I mean we were just dancing with
the President and
Usher and Sasha and stuff.

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:It's no big deal.
>> [LAUGH]
>> They took your phones when you went in.
So they didn't want any videos or
pictures or anything.
But I snuck my phone in.
And I was sitting next to the President
when they sang Happy Birthday to him.
So, this is exclusive footage from
the President's birthday party.

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:>> [MUSIC]
>> [APPLAUSE]
>> That's not-

>> It's not him.
>> [APPLAUSE]
>> No,
that was from Portia's birthday party.

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:>> [LAUGH]
>> That was where,
I'll tell you about what happened,
what really happened there tomorrow,
cuz it was a lot of fun.
But right now I want to celebrate
the start of season 14 with all of you
with a dance!
Hey, you know what?

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:I always want this show to be a break
from whatever bad things are going on in
the world.
I want my words to bring you joy.
I want my actions to
bring you inspiration.
I want my milkshake to
bring you to the yard.
>> [LAUGH]
>> It's not always

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:easy to find uplifting stories,
but I found some.
I did some research cuz I want to
come out here and be positive,
and happy, and stuff.
So here's three things
that happened recently.
The first one is from
a website called Foodbeast.
Lucky girl finds world's
longest cheeto in her bag.

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:>> [LAUGH]
>> Here's what it looks like.
>> [LAUGH]
>> Yeah.
>> [LAUGH]
>> How did that eve sit in the bag?
>> [LAUGH]
>> That's crazy.
That was posted on Twitter
by someone named Weedbees.
>> [LAUGH]
>> You know weed had to be involved

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:somehow.
>> [LAUGH]
>> they think that the Cheeto
might have been a foot long, but nobody
got to measure it because this is true,
the woman's roommate ended up eating it.
>> [LAUGH]
>> That is the power of weed,
it giveth and it taketh away.

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:>> [LAUGH] [APPLAUSE]
>> So the, yeah, it does.
>> [LAUGH]
>> People too high to clap.
Yes, it does, Ellen.
>> [LAUGH]
>> The next story is from
the New York Magazine.
One of their producers wrote about his
mother going to a convention for furries.

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:If you don't know what furries are,
furries are people that have a fetish.
They like to dress up in animal costumes.
And they have conventions and I think
that's a reason Twitch is not here today.
>> [LAUGH]
>> [LAUGH] Anyway, here's what he posted.
My mom thought furrycon was a pet event
and volunteered with our therapy dog.
That dog got a lot of phone
numbers at that convention.

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:>> [LAUGH]
>> Finally,
I found this story in the Wall Street
Journal about a new sport that
requires gymnastics skill,
strength and endurance.
And this is what it is.
[MUSIC]
>> [LAUGH]

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:[MUSIC]
[LAUGH]
>> So that is called hobby horsing.
I think it was invented by parents who
didn't wanna buy their daughter a pony
cuz-
>> [LAUGH]
>> They say that it's popular because it

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:gives young girls a sense of belonging.
They're gonna find out later in life,
they don't belong.
>> [LAUGH]
>> That's not, [LAUGH] not really okay.
But anyway,
they say don't knock until you try it.
So bring me my horse, I got one.
>> [APPLAUSE]

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:>> Well, okay.
Come on Wildfire, let's dance.
so listen everybody I stopped for gas on
the way to work and Wow
gas is expensive it is expensive it is
close to $5 a gallon I almost didn't

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:have enough money left over for my
chewing tobacco so while I was getting
gas I went inside the store and I just
can't I don't even understand what's
happening here do you do you realize how
many energy drinks there are out there

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:in the world have you noticed how many
energy drinks there are alright there's
a lot so it's it's insane so I brought
some with me just so we could discuss it
okay so here's what was it that and
there at the register like all of a

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:sudden it's like whoo I need energy and
it's just right there so this one right
here is called the 5-hour energy right
here and I am suspicious of anything
that lasts 5 hours
cuz I thought of it last for hours he is

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:supposed to see a doctor so fine so I
read the back of the box and it says if
you look back there it says eight
thousand three hundred and thirty three
percent of your daily value of b12 eight
thousand three hundred and thirty three

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:percent that's gonna last you 2 2013 37
or something like this you'll never need
b12 again in your life I've never I'm
not a doctor
I've played doctor but that seems like
too much and but for some people five

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:hours is not enough somebody some
somebody said hey I'll figure out a way
to to beat them now they sell seven hour
energy who needs seven hours of energy
I mean besides sting this the size of
this this is called juice and it's an

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:energy energy drink with alcohol yes
so now if you have a really bad idea
when you're drunk you'll have the energy
to follow through with it
what happened to the good old days but
I'm gonna get a look

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:on the side this is great too on the
side there's a skull see that now when I
was a kid that meant poison that was the
warning sign not to drink it this is on
here they're proud of that here I bought
a whole case of this this is called tilt

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:I don't know if you've heard of tilt but
this is crazy this is 24 ounces and 12%
alcohol it's uh it's like drinking like
six beers which is why I felt so drunk
after I chug one it is full of caffeine
and alcohol because hey if your heart's

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:gonna explode your liver should be on in
it to you don't let your liver miss out
on that see here's all these drinks and
they're they give you energy but they're
making these drinks that are supposed to
help you relax now because now you have

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:this and now they go well we need
something to help you relax because so
here's this this is called just chill
and clearly named by a teenager
and then on the back you read the back
right here it says why sit on a

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:mountaintop in Tibet when one sip of
just chill gives you an instant
enlightenment and then it goes on to say
just chill the natural enemy of stress
tell all your monkeys if you see where
it says that tell all your monkeys okay

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:couple of things I don't talk to my
monkeys my assistant does that for me
number two what what your monkeys now
you have all these drinks that give you
energy and I don't know we need to buy
drinks to chill us out we here's that's

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:like you you get you have the energy you
have the the chill thing it's like
joining a gym that's inside of a Pizza
Hut like okay I'll get everything at
once
why are we buying all these drinks I

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:mean the cave people didn't come from a
long day of gathering and go ugh me
tired me need sugar water in three
thousand percent of b12 if they needed
energy they took a nap and occasionally
they'd Club someone over the head

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:I'm not saying everything was perfect
back then but still I think here's a
radical idea if you want something
soothing that hydrates you and quenches
your thirst try this this is water
and it comes right out of the tap can

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:you imagine but if you really want to
live on the edge
I recommend vitamin water zero and it's
great taste it's filled with vitamins
and electrolytes and zero calories and
also you didn't hear it from me but it's

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:a great mixer
- YOU ALL LOOK GREAT,
BY THE WAY.
I SHOULD SAY THAT.
AND I MEAN IT.
[cheers and applause]
I'M REALLY--I'M BEING HONEST,
'CAUSE SOMETIMES I COME OUT HERE
AND I SAY,

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:"YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK GREAT,"
AND INSIDE I'M THINKING,
"SOME OF YOU COULD USE
A HAIRCUT."
[laughter]
MY AUDIENCES ALWAYS LOOK GREAT.
I'M VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT.

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
HERE'S THE THING.
I HAVE BEEN THINKING A LOT
ABOUT HONESTY LATELY,
AND I THINK--I SAID I WAS GONNA
START BEING MORE HONEST IN 2010,
SO I'M STARTING NOW.
[laughter]
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:WE'RE A COUNTRY FOUNDED
ON HONESTY.
REALLY, WE'RE FOUNDED BY
HONEST ABE AND GORGEOUS GEORGE
AND THE ROCK AND...
I'M THINKING OF WRESTLERS.
BUT THE POINT IS,
FOR THE MOST PART,
WE'RE HONEST PEOPLE,

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:WHICH IS GOOD,
BECAUSE EVERYTHING AROUND US
IS BASED ON THE HONOR SYSTEM.
IF YOU REALLY LOOK AT THAT.
LIKE, AT THE AIRPORT,
THE BAGGAGE CLAIM, YOU KNOW.
THOSE THINGS
ARE JUST GOING AROUND.
THERE'S BAGS
JUST CIRCLING AROUND.

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:ANYONE COULD TAKE 'EM.
AND I KNOW, 'CAUSE I TOOK
FOUR OF 'EM, AND NOBODY...
JUST GRABBED THEM AND...
I GOT SOME GOOD STUFF.
I GOT, LIKE, THREE TRAVEL IRONS
AND A REALLY NICE LARGE
MAN'S NIGHT SHIRT, SO...

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:AND, YOU KNOW, YOU GO TO STORES,
AND THE CHECKOUT LANE,
THERE'S ALWAYS LITTLE THINGS
THAT YOU CAN EITHER--IT SAYS--
IT'S A TRAY,
AND IT'S LIKE TAKE OR LEAVE
A PENNY.
AND I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE TAKE
THE PENNIES
AND--I'VE SEEN 'EM.

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:YOU KNOW, THEY JUST DUMP IT.
I DON'T DO THAT.
I FISH AROUND FOR THE DIMES.
AND I SEE SOMETIMES THEY'RE
IN THERE BELOW THE PENNIES.
LOOK AROUND.
AND THERE'S SO MANY PLACES
THAT RELY ON US TO BE HONEST.
LIKE BANKS PUT THE CANDY OUT

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:AND RESTAURANTS
PUT TOOTHPICKS OUT
AND COSTCO PUTS ALL THE--
GOD, THERE'S SO MANY
FREE SAMPLES OF FOOD.
YOU COULD EAT LUNCH AND DINNER,
AND MAMA DOES.
SHE GOES THERE FOR LUNCH
AND SHE FILLS UP.
AND--BUT WE'RE SO TRUSTING,
I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:WE GO TO--THE VALETS.
THAT'S THE THINGS.
VALETS--OUR CARS--WE JUST GIVE
OUR KEYS TO SOMEBODY
JUST 'CAUSE THEY'RE WEARING
A VEST.
AND NOW YOU KNOW WHY I WEAR
SO MANY VESTS.
[laughter]
AND I HAVE SO MANY CARS.
THAT'S WHY.

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:WHAT I'M SAYING IS, I THINK
WE CAN'T ALWAYS BE HONEST,
BUT AT LEAST LET'S BE HONEST
WITH THE FACT
THAT WE'RE DISHONEST SOMETIMES.
AND LIKE LAST WEEKEND.
I'LL START.
OKAY, LET'S JUST BE HONEST
ABOUT THINGS, AND I'LL SHARE,
AND THEN IF Y'ALL FEEL LIKE IT.

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:BUT I SAW THREE MOVIES,
AND I PAID FOR ONE.
AND, UH...
AND I PAID CHILD'S PRICE,
AND I SNUCK IN MY OWN POPCORN
AND MY OWN CHEF.

on vacation for about a week and a half

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:and you had to watch some reruns which
were lovely reruns and not don't get me
wrong but I like working that's what
I've realized I don't like taking a
vacation we went I took a vacation and
it was just not relaxing at all I like I

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:like to work I don't know how to slow
down from the moment I landed I went I
flew to Mexico and got in at night so
you don't see anything it's dark and the
ride from the airport was anything but
relaxing this is the beginning of my

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:vacation the driver I don't know if they
do it in kilometers or miles per hour or
pesos but they the he was driving so
fast I mean like for like just like a
hundred miles an hour down and it's just
dark and things were darting out which I

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:didn't know what they were at first they
turned out to be little Jackrabbits I'm
not saying he was aiming for him but he
wasn't it let him slow him down this is
my relaxing vacation and you know how
much I love animals some I mean because

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:there's Jackrabbits everywhere there's a
huge Jackrabbit population in Mexico
where they used to be anyway and judging
from the roads there's not as many as
they they used to have and I love
animals so I'm like saying to God please

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:please don't don't hit the rabbit and
and he shouldn't Yuri too laughing like
you know it's nothing he just didn't
think anything of the rabbits in front
of him and so I get to the hotel and I'm
trying to slow down I don't know I don't

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:know how to just sit and do nothing and
it's hard to relax when you don't speak
the language that makes it harder
because you're trying to be quiet and
yet I'm yelling slowly that's how I'm
trying

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:that to me helps you communicate and I
didn't know how to I'm bad at the
languages and I'm putting L in front of
everything else
because I'd forgotten my toothbrush and
so and I'm going out

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:toothbrush oh and and I do that and they
bring me a moustache brush which was
insulting I'll tell you because I had
brought my moustache brush I had that
but it's beautiful don't get me wrong
Mexico is beautiful and we're right on

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:the ocean which is lovely to hear the
ocean which I was already hearing
because I had an inner ear infection so
I heard that here and but so we were
supposed to stay seven days and left
after two days because I don't I didn't

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:know what to do with myself I was sick
when I got there so I was on antibiotics
and I couldn't I couldn't be in the Sun
cuz the antibiotics I couldn't drink and
so and I already go in the ocean and
there's undertow warning so I'm thinking

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:okay I'll get a spa treatment so I'll go
to get a facial and I'm in a dark room
for about an hour and a half and as soon
as I'm finished they say would you like
to shut it to kilo and which is they
offer you after everything there by the

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:way did I mention how nice the people
are and so I you know I and I said no I
can't have to kill I'm on antibiotics
and they're like oh it's medicine it's
okay and I'm like no I really can't and
then they push me out of the facial room

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:into the everything is white there by
the way so blinding white but just after
being in the dark for an hour and I'm
trying to find my way back to where I'm
changing and somehow I felt my way back
to a tequila bar I don't know it's like

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:a bar full of you know they I didn't
know they had like 50 different types of
tequila and I kept saying I can't have
tequila I don't I'm on antibiotics and
so anyway I'm sitting there thinking oh
this order lunch and this table next to

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:me if some tourists are talking about me
and I can tell they think they're being
quiet but I can hear them and so then
the man comes over finally and he goes

[Applause]

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:and I said no I'm not and and he looks
back at his wife she goes yes it is and
I said no I'm Ellen he goes Helen Ellen

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:personality that gets it right away so
thrilled did now did you get it on
December first or did you just get it
December 1st what's that you got yours
in November you're kidding me all right
- see this is what I'm I can't even

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:believe this this is it to me there's so
many big decisions to make in December
there's like one well two three big
decisions there's the the what you get
people for gifts that you know what kind
of gifts you get that's big decision a

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:lot a lot of energy goes into that and
then how much brandy to put in the
eggnog that's a second one
that was just for the cup so yeah cuz
you need the eggnog because you're
stressed because you got to pick out the

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:gifts and then you got to pick out the
Christmas tree you got to decide when to
buy the Christmas tree and and and our
house you know so Porsha and I were
talking the other day and she said you
know December 1st we have to get the

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:tree everybody knows you get the tree
December 1st and you take it down
January 1st I said no not everybody
knows that that is not a she goes no
that's what everybody does I said maybe
on Australia they do that but that is

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:not what we do here people get it at
different times but she was ready to get
it on the 1st and I'm like it's too
early because it's gonna get all dried
out and to get it that people in
November getting Christmas trees after

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:Thanksgiving you're not gonna have a
tree by Christmas you're gonna have just
like twigs it's just a fire hazard just
sitting in your house just and the
picking out of the tree is the craziest
decision - it is so what we do when we

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:go walking through a lot to pick out the
exact right tree and like we're so
scrutinizing that every single like on
that when the branch sticks out a tiny
bit it's not I guess if we turn that
part to the wall spin it again let me

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:see the backside of it it's like we're
buying a sofa or something it's and
they're expensive they're like upwards
of $20 now they're so
it's a tree that's all it is you know
you don't even keep it in a pot you just

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:you know what you need you need a truck
a chainsaw and a bottle of Jack Daniels
and Merry Christmas
one year I did that one year and I had
too much Jack Daniels I came home with a
ficus and I thought it was a Christmas

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:tree you went from the side and then
once you get the tree home then
everybody has an opinion on how to keep
it alive basically you know it's it's
not so much alive it's just delaying the
slow and that inevitably death that it's

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:gonna so you put sugar in the water you
do that and then you do 7up or seven and
seven you put something in there one of
our our staff members Kevin Leman his
mom and this is the truth she said the
way that you keep a tree fresh is you

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:throw the tree in your swimming pool and
I don't know how long you're supposed to
leave it there but you throw the tree
and it absorbs all the water and she
promises that that's how it stays a long
time is throwing the pool the Christmas

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:tree in a pool so if you have an idea I
want to hear it go to our website and
tell us your remedy and and how you when
you put your tree up how you keep it
alive and I'll give you my tip right now
on how to keep it smelling fresh and

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:this is an old DeGeneres family secret
what I do is half of my ornaments on the
tree or the pine air fresheners
and the good news is the house smells
pine fresh and then one year I didn't
even put a tree up I just got a large

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:air freshener and then put little baby
pine fresheners hanging ornaments on
that
then you got to get rid of the tree
that's the hard thing bringing it in
there's so much fun and then if you wait

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:too long oh man those people like you
November you know and you're trying to
drag it out it is just and you have to
have gloves and like a hazmat suit on
because it's just you're going to get
poked it's so sharp and it's just and

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:you're dragging basically a trail of you
know just burn it just is just it's like
dried needles just all the way out the
door and then you're sweeping you never
get all the needles out some people take
forever to even bring their their tree

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:out you're driving in the middle of
February you see a tree in front of
their house you can't help but judge
those people you can't like that's when
you take it down they probably have
Halloween candy still sitting in bowls

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:by the door for the kids I'm gonna hurry
to get the tree out of there cuz it
gives me more room to dance
I like to do the one two step and I love
it when you want to step everybody you
know

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:- YOU FEEL OKAY?

I WANT TO
okay so I want to tell you all about

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:something that happened to me the other
day and I know y'all can relate to this
because it's happened to everybody a
piece of clothing disappeared out of my
house have you have you ever lost a
piece of clothing and you go how can it

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:just disappear how can I lose I was
wearing a jacket the other day it was
freezing in LA it was like 68 over the
weekend it was cold it was cold and it
was rainy and so I had on a jacket I've
had for years and it's one of my

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:favorite jackets and I had a little knit
little grey hat and I had that in the
pocket with my favorite hat my favorite
jacket and so uh we had been out I'd
been wearing it and then I get home and
I forgot it that it was in the back seat

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:so I ran out to the car grabbed it from
the back seat I remember all this go
into the house put it in the house and
then it's just then later that night I
can't find it it's just gone and I
because I thought I hung it in the

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:closet and then I saw the hanger and I
was like there's no jacket there was
just a hanger so then I retraced my
steps and I'm walking through the house
maybe I put on the kitchen counter but I
don't do things like that I hang things

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:up so I'm like so then I'm thinking
somebody else picked it up and put it in
another closet so I start looking in
every closet in the house I look in all
the bedrooms I look in the laundry room
I look in the great room I look in the

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:good room I look at all the rooms I'm
looking under sofas I'm looking under
pillows I'm looking anywhere and I
accused Portia of stealing it I held my
mother for questioning
it was gone it was nowhere and you know

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:how when you lose your sunglasses and
you spend hours looking and then they're
on your head so I thought AHA I checked
the top of my head but no jacket and
then I decided there were three
possibilities and here they were one

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:there's a ghost in my house who has
great style to David Copperfield pulled
off the greatest illusion ever or three
it was Jennifer Aniston I blamed it on
Jennifer because she's always loved that
jacket but those leads didn't pan out it

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:was just gone it was just so frustrating
because Portia kept telling me he
probably left it somewhere and I kept
saying I know I didn't leave it anywhere
you're wrong I was in the house we
didn't go anywhere else I don't lose

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:things where are my keys and so but
anyway just vanished and I thought how
could something vanish into thin air how
could it be there and then just be gone
and what if this becomes one of those
freaky unsolved mysteries that you see

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:on TV so yesterday the mystery was
solved I forgot that after we were home
we did go back out again and I left it
at a rug store not a wig store a rug
like a rug so the jacket didn't just
vanish into thin air the jacket was at a

name:Ellen Degeneres

text:store and anyway you probably wondering
why I'm telling you this long story
because I'm supposed to say something
right now Portia you were right
there's more you're always right and I'm
so raw

I would be, like, Shaquille

Just for, like, the change of perspective.
Shaq for the first twelve hours,
Danny DeVito for the back twelve.
It would be cool.
Sometimes, like, my wife is 5’1”.

“Hey, is this what the

Ok, this is from Abu.

You know what’s crazy?
Last week we did our China episode.
Is anyone here from
mainland China, out of curiosity?
No one? Ok, cool.
Alright, we didn’t
hit that target demo.

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:But someone was like, “Hey, we
put up your episode on Weibo.”
Which is, like, their version of, like,
it’s a social media platform.
And they’re like,
“It’s still up. Looks like
you’re not that popular.”
I really took it to heart.

Why did they do that?”

I know, but you’re just like,
“You know, the prompter. The desks

Like, “What inanimate object do you...?”
Uh, what do I miss besides...
Uh, what do I miss?

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:And it can’t be people?
This is tough. It isn’t a person.
I love everyone there,

But I have to be like,
“Oh man, lunches on Thursdays.”
Eddie, if you had to answer that,
how would you answer that?

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:Like, what is the one thing you love most about this job besides people.
You can’t name a person.
It’s a hard question, right?
Ok. That’s fair enough. The slate?!
What did I think was really fun there?
You know what?
The Daily Show dogs.

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:Jon made it like a dog-friendly office.
And I originally was
very afraid of dogs.
Um, a lot of you guys know our
general position about dogs.
But then like when I was in the office,
like, you’d be sitting in a writer’s meeting,
and they’d like come up to you,
they’d put their paw on your, you know.

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:And, like, they would look up at you, like,
“Hey, let’s be friends.”
‘Cause I used to be like, “Man,
get this dog away from me.”
Like my position on dogs was, like, that,
remember that Kerpal skit?
Like, “Man, I’ll kick this dog.
Get it away from me.”

name:Hasan Minhaj

text:But then I was like,
no they’re, like, you can see
the humanity in their eyes,
they just wanna be friends with you.
So yeah, yeah.
I still think when they take
a dump inside, it’s gross.
