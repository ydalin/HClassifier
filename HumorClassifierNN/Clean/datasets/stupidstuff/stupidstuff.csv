pieces of copper. After studying these pieces for a long time,
Germany announced that the ancient Germans had a nationwide

down, they found small pieces of glass, and they soon announced that

anything to be the greatest gunfighter in the world. He practiced every minute of his spare time, but he knew that he wasn't yet first-rate and that there must be something he was doing wrong. 

Sitting in a saloon one Saturday night, he recognized an elderly man seated at the bar who had the reputation of being the fastest gun in the West in his day. The young cowboy took a seat next to the old-timer, bought him a drink, and told him the story of his great 
ambition. 
 
""Do you think you could give me some tips?"" he asked. 
 The old man looked him up and down and said, ""Well, for one thing, you're wearing your gun too high. Tie the holster a lil' lower down on your leg."" 
 ""Will that make me a better gunfighter?"" asked the young man. 
 ""Sure will,"" said the old-timer. 
 The young man did as he was told, stood up, whipped out his .44 and shot the bow tie off the piano player. 

""That's terrific!"" said the cowboy. ""Got any more tips for me?"" 
 
""Yep,"" said the old man. ""Cut a notch out of your holster where the hammer 
 hits it. That'll give you a smoother draw."" 
 ""Will that make me a better gunfighter?"" asked the younger man. 
 ""You bet it will,"" said the old-timer. 
 The young man took out his knife, cut the notch, stood up, drew his gun in a 
blur, then shot a cufflink off the piano player. ""Wow!"" said the cowboy. 
 ""I'm learnin' somethin' here. Got any more tips?"" 

The old man pointed to a large can in a corner of the saloon. ""See that axle 
grease over there? Coat your gun with it."" 
 The young man went over to the can and smeared some of the grease on the  barrel of his gun. 

""No,"" said the old-timer, ""I mean smear it all over the gun, handle and 
all.""

The man said, ""Build a bridge to Hawaii so I can drive over anytime I want.""

The Lord said, ""Your request is very materialistic. Think of the enormous challenges for that kind of undertaking. The supports required to reach the bottom of the Pacific! The concrete and steel it would take! It will nearly exhaust several natural resources. I can do it, but it is hard for me to justify your desire for worldly things.

"THE GAG TEST:Anything that makes you gag is spoiled (except for leftovers from what you cooked for yourself last night). EGGS:When something starts pecking its way out of the shell, the egg is probably past its prime. DAIRY PRODUCTS:Milk is spoiled when it starts to look like yoghurt.  Yoghurt is spoiled when it starts to look like cottage cheese.  Cottage cheese is spoiled when it starts to look like regular cheese.  Regular cheese is nothing but spoiled milk anyway and can't get any more spoiled than it is already.  Cheddar cheese is spoiled when you think it is blue cheese but you realise you've never purchased that kind. MAYONNAISE:If it makes you violently ill after you eat it, the mayonnaise is spoiled. FROZEN FOODS:Frozen foods that have become an integral part of the defrosting problem in your freezer compartment will probably be spoiled (or wreckedanyway) by the time you pry them out with a kitchen knife. EXPIRATION DATES:This is NOT a marketing ploy to encourage you to throw away perfectly good food so that you'll spend more on groceries.  Perhaps you'd benefit by having a calendar in your kitchen. MEAT:           If opening the refrigerator door causes stray animals from a three-block radius to congregate outside your house, the meat is spoiled. BREAD:Sesame seeds and Poppy seeds are the only officially acceptable ""spots"" that should be seen on the surface of any loaf of bread.  Fuzzy and hairy-looking white or green growth areas are a good indication that your bread has turned into a pharmaceutical laboratory experiment. FLOUR:Flour is spoiled when it wiggles. SALT:It never spoils. CANNED GOODS:Any canned goods that have become the size or shape of a tennis ball should be disposed of. Carefully. CARROTS:A carrot that you can tie a clove hitch in is not fresh. RAISINS AND SULTANAS:Raisins and sultanas should not be harder than your teeth. POTATOES:Fresh potatoes do not have roots, branches, or dense, leafy undergrowth. CHIP DIP:If you can take it out of its container and bounce it on the floor, it has gone bad. EMPTY CONTAINERS:Putting empty containers back into the refrigerator is an old trick, but it only works if you live with your mother or have a maid. UNMARKED ITEMS:You know it is well beyond prime when you're tempted to discard the Tupperware along with the food. Generally speaking, Tupperware containers should not burp when you open them. GENERAL RULE OF THUMB:Most food cannot be kept longer than the average life span of a hamster. Keep a hamster in or nearby your refrigerator to gauge this.","Men",292,4

""Hey,"" says the lone hunter, ""I don't want to tell you how to do something... but I can tell you that it's much easier if you drag the deer in the opposite direction. Then the antlers won't dig into the ground."" After the lone hunter left, the two rednecks decided to give it a try. A little while later one says to the other, ""Ya know, that guy was right.

But then he said that they could blindfold him and he would recognize any animal's skin from its feel, and if he could locate the bullet hole he would even tell them what calibre the bullet was that killed the animal. The hunter said that he was willing to prove it if they would put up the drinks, and so the bet was on. They blindfolded him carefully and took him to his first animal skin. After feeling it for a few moments, he announced ""Bear."" Then he felt the bullet hole and declared, ""Shot with a .308 rifle."" He was right.They brought him another skin, one that someone had in their car trunk. He took a bit longer this time and then said, ""Elk, Shot with a 7mm Mag rifle. He was right again.

"Dear Sir or Madam;

While working with Mr. Smith, I have always found him
working studiously and sincerely at his table without idling or
gossiping with colleagues in the office. He seldom
wastes his time on useless things. Given a job, he always
finishes the given assignment in time. He is always
deeply engrossed in his official work, and can never be
found chitchatting in the canteen. He has absolutely no
vanity in spite of his high accomplishment and profound
knowledge of his field. I think he can easily be
classed as outstanding, and should on no account be
dispensed with. I strongly feel that Mr. Smith should be
pushed to accept promotion, and a proposal to administration be
sent away as soon as possible.

I had her try yours on for me and she looked really smart. I wish I was there to put them on for you the first time, as no doubt other hands will come in contact with them before I have a chance to see you again.

"Several centuries ago, the Pope decided that all the Jews had to leave the Vatican. Naturally there was a big uproar from the Jewish community. So the Pope made a deal. He would have a religious debate with a member of the Jewish community. If the Jew won, the Jews could stay. If the Pope won, the Jews would leave. The Jews realized that they had no choice. So they picked an elderly aged man named Moishe to represent them. Rabbi Moishe's Latin wasn't very good - in fact, he knew very little--but he was a man of great faith and well respected in the Jewish community. The pope agreed. What could be easier than a silent debate?

Moishe looked back at him and raised one finger. The Pope waved his fingers in a circle around his head. Moishe pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope pulled out a wafer and a glass of wine. Moishe pulled out an apple. The Pope stood up and said, ""I give up. This man is too good. The Jews can stay."" 

An hour later, the cardinals were all around the Pope asking him what happened. The Pope said: ""First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up one finger to remind me that there was still one God common to both our religions. Then I waved my finger around me to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground and showing that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and the wafer to show that God absolves us from our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of original sin. He had an answer for everything. What could I do?"" 

Meanwhile, the Jewish community had crowded around Moishe. ""What happened?"" they asked. ""Well,"" said Moishe, ""First he said to me that the Jews had three days to get out of here. I told him that not one of us was leaving. Then he told me that this whole city would be cleared of Jews. I let him know that we were staying right here."" ""And then?"" asked a woman.

"On the farm lived a chicken and a horse, both of whom loved to play
together. One day, the two were playing, when the horse fell into a bog and began to sink.  Scared for his life, the horse whinnied for the chicken to go get the farmer for help! Off the chicken ran, back to the farm. 
  
Arriving at the farm, he searched and searched for the farmer, but to no
avail, for he had gone to town with the only tractor.  Running around, the
chicken spied the farmer's new Harley. Finding the keys in the ignition, the
chicken sped off with a length of rope hoping he still had time to save his
friend's life. 
  
Back at the bog, the horse was surprised, but happy, to see the chicken arrive on the shiny Harley, and he managed to get a hold of the loop of rope the chicken tossed to him. After tying the other end to the rear bumper of the farmer's bike, the chicken then drove slowly forward and, with the aid of the powerful bike, rescued the horse! Happy and proud, the chicken rode the Harley back to the farmhouse, and the farmer was none the wiser when he returned. 
  
The friendship between the two animals was cemented:  Best Buddies, Best
Pals. 
  A few weeks later, the chicken fell into a mud pit, and soon, he too,
began to sink and cried out to the horse to save his life.  The horse
thought a moment, walked over, and straddled the large puddle. Looking
underneath, he told the chicken to grab his hangy-down thing and he could
then lift him out of the pit. The chicken got a good grip, and the horse
pulled him up and out, saving his life.

"One day, down in the mystical forest, a magical frog was hopping towards a water hole. The forest was so enormous that the frog had never laid eyes on another animal before. But today, by chance a bear was chasing after a rabbit to have for dinner. 

The frog called for the two to stop and said, ""Because you are the only two animals I have seen, I will grant both of you three wishes. Bear, you can go first."" The bear thought for a moment, and being the male he was, said, ""I wish for all the bears in this forest, apart from me, to be female."" 

For his wish, the rabbit asked for a crash helmet, and immediately put it on. The bear was amazed at the stupidity of the rabbit, wasting his wish like that. 

It was the bear's second turn for a wish. ""Well, I wish that all the bears in the next forest were female as well."" 

The rabbit asked for a motorcycle and immediately hopped on it and roared the engine. The bear was shocked that the rabbit was asking for such idiotic items, because after all, he could have asked for money and bought the bike. 

For the last wish the bear thought for a while and then said, ""I wish that all the bears in the world, apart from me, were female."" 

The rabbit grinned, roared the engine, and said, ""I wish that the bear was gay.""","Money",803,4.33

"Moses and Jesus were in a threesome playing golf one day. Moses pulled up to the tee and drove a long one. The ball landed in the fairway, but rolled directly toward a water hazard. Quickly Moses raised his club, the water parted and it rolled to the other side, safe and sound. Next, Jesus strolled up to the tee and hit a nice long one directly toward the same water hazard. It landed right in the centre of the pond and kind of hovered over the water. Jesus casually walked out on the pond and chipped the ball onto the green. The third guy got up and randomly whacked the ball. It headed out over the fence and into oncoming traffic on a nearby street. It bounced off a truck and hit a nearby tree. From there, it bounced onto the roof of a shack close by and rolled down into the gutter, down the drain spout, out onto the fairway and straight toward the aforementioned pond. On the way to the pond, the ball hit a stone and bounced out over the water onto a lily pad, where it rested quietly. Suddenly a very large bullfrog jumped up on a lily pad and snatched the ball into his mouth. Just then, an eagle swooped down and grabbed the frog and flew away. As they passed over the green, the frog squealed with fright and dropped the ball, which bounced right into the cup for a hole in one.

"Martha Stewart Vs. Real Women:


MARTHA STEWART 

If you accidentally over-salt a dish while it's still cooking, drop in a peeled potato and it will absorb the excess salt for an instant ""fix-me-up. 

REAL WOMEN 

If you over-salt a dish while you are cooking, that's too damn bad. Please recite with me, The Real Women's motto: ""I made it and you will eat it and I don't care how bad it tastes.""

Cure for headaches: Take a lime, cut it in half and rub it on your forehead. The throbbing will go away.

"Two old pensioners are taking a trip down memory lane by going back to the place where they first met. 

Sitting at a caf\u00e9, the little old man says, ""Remember the first time I met you over 50 years ago? We left this cafe, went round the corner behind the gas works, and I gave you one from behind.""

Sure enough, he sees the two pensioners near the gas works. The little old lady pulls off her knickers and lifts up her dress. 

The old man pulls down his pants and grabs the lady's hips, and the little old lady reaches for the fence. Well, what follows is 40 minutes of the most athletic sex the man has ever seen.

Limbs are flying everywhere, the movement is a blur, and they do not stop for a single second. Finally, they collapse and don't move for an hour. 

Well, the man is stunned. Never in his life has he ever seen anything that equates to this -- not in the movies, not from his friends, not from his own experiences.

"A couple was invited to a swanky masked Halloween Party. The wife got a terrible headache and told her husband to go to the party alone. He, being a devoted husband, protested, but she argued and said she was going to take some aspirin and go to bed, and there was no need of his good time being spoiled by not going. So he took his costume and away he went. The wife, after sleeping soundly for one hour, awakened without pain. As it was still early, she decided to go to the party. Since her husband did not know what her costume was, she thought she would have some fun watching him to see how he acted when she was not with him. She joined the party and soon spotted her husband cavorting around on the dance floor, dancing with every nice woman he could, copping a little feel here and a little kiss there. His wife sidled up to him. As a rather seductive babe herself, he left his partner high and dry and devoted his time to the new stuff that had just arrived. She let him go as far as he wished; naturally, since he was her husband. Finally he whispered a little proposition in her ear and she agreed, so off they went to one of the cars and had sex. Just before unmasking at midnight, she slipped away, went home, put the costume away and got into bed, wondering what kind of explanation he would make for his behavior. She was sitting up reading when he came in and she asked how the party was. He said, ""Oh, the same old thing. You know I never have a good time when you're not there."" Then she asked, ""Did you dance much?"" He replied, ""I'll tell you, I never even danced one dance.

"A nice young man wanted to purchase a Christmas
gift for his new sweetheart. As they had not been dating very long,
after some careful consideration, he decided that a pair of elegant winter gloves would strike just the right note - romantic, but not too personal.

Accompanied by his sweetheart's younger sister, he went to a
fine department store and chose a pair of lovely white fur-lined gloves. The sister did her own shopping, buying a pair of panties for herself. 

While the clerk was wrapping the items, she got the boxes mixed up, and gave the gloves to the sister and gift-wrapped the panties for the young man.

The young man sealed the package without noticing and sent it to his sweetheart, who opened it on Christmas to find his enclosed note:


I chose these because I noticed that you are not in the habit of wearing any when we go out in the evening. If it had not been for your sister, I would have chosen the long ones with the  buttons, but she demonstrated the short ones she wears that are easier to remove.
These are a delicate shade, but the lady I bought them from
Showed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and they were hardly soiled. I had her try yours on for me and she looked very sharp.

I wish I was there to put them on for you the first time, as no doubt other hands will come in contact with them before I have a chance to see you again. When you take them off, remember to blow in them before putting them away, as they will naturally be a little damp from wearing.

Just think how many times I will kiss them during the coming
year. I hope you will wear them for me on Friday night. 
All my love. 

(P.S... The latest style is to wear them folded down with a little fur showing.","Love & Romance",892,3.8

The bartender would squeeze a lemon until all the juice ran into a glass, and hand the lemon to a patron. Anyone who could squeeze one more drop of juice out would win the money. Many people had tried over time (weight-lifters, longshoremen, etc.) but nobody could do it. One day this scrawny little man came into the bar, wearing thick glasses and a polyester suit, and said in a tiny squeaky voice "" I'd like to try the bet"" After the laughter had died down, the bartender said OK, grabbed a lemon, and squeezed away. Then he handed the wrinkled remains of the rind to the little man. But the crowd's laughter turned to total silence as the man clenched his fist around the lemon and six drops fell into the glass. As the crowd cheered, the bartender paid the $1000, and asked the little man ""what do you do for a living? Are you a lumberjack, a weight-lifter, or what?"" The man replied ""I work for the IRS.""","Money",912,2.67

"When the body was first made, all the parts wanted to be the boss.

The brain said, ""since I control everything and do all the thinking, I should be the boss.""

The feet said, ""since I carry man where he wants to go and get him in position to do what the brain wants, then I should be the boss.""

The hands said, ""since I must do all the work and earn all the money to keep the rest of you going, I should be the boss.""

And so it went with the eyes, the heart, the lungs, and all the other parts of the body, each giving the reason why they should be the boss.

Finally, the butthole spoke up and said it was going to be the boss.

All the other parts laughed and laughed at the idea of the butthole being the boss. The butthole got so angry that he blocked himself off and refused to function.

And so it happened; all the other parts did all the work and the butthole just bossed and passed out a lot of crap.

"This is the best lawyer story of the year, decade and probably the century.A Charlotte, NC, lawyer purchased a box of very rare and expensive cigars,then insured them against fire among other things. Within a month having smoked his entire stockpile of these great cigars and without yet having made even his first premium payment on the policy, the lawyer filed claim against the insurance company.In his claim, the lawyer stated the cigars were lost ""in a series of small fires.""The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason: that the man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion. The lawyer sued....and won!In delivering the ruling the judge agreed with the insurance company that the claim was frivolous. The Judge stated nevertheless, that the lawyer held a policy from the company in which it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that it would insure them against fire,without defining what is considered to be unacceptable fire,"" and was obligated to pay the claim.Rather than endure lengthy and costly appeal process, the insurance company accepted the ruling and paid $15,000.00 to the lawyer for his loss of the rare cigars lost in the ""fires.""NOW FOR THE BEST PART... After the lawyer cashed the check, the insurance company had him arrested on 24 counts of ARSON!!!! With his own insurance claim andtestimony from the previous case being used against him, the lawyer was convicted of intentionally burning his insured property and was sentenced to 24 months in jail and a $24,000.00 fine.This is a true story and was the 1st place winner in the recent Criminal Lawyers Award Contest.ONLY IN AMERICA","Miscellaneous",1043,4.5
"A Fishy tale.Far away in the tropical waters of the Caribbean, two prawns were swimming around in the sea - one called Justin and the other called Christian.The  prawns were constantly being harassed and threatened by sharks that patrolled the area.  Finally one day Justin said to Christian, ""I'm bored and frustrated at being a prawn; I wish I was a shark, and then I wouldn't have any worries about being eaten...""As Justin had his mind firmly on becoming a predator, a mysterious cod appears and says, ""Your wish is granted"", and lo and behold, Justin turned into a shark.Horrified, Christian immediately swam away, afraid of being eaten by his old mate.  Time went on (as it invariably does...) and Justin found himself becoming bored and lonely as a shark.  All his old mates simply swam away whenever he came close to them.  Justin didn't realise that his new menacing appearance was the cause of his sad plight.While out swimming alone one day he sees the mysterious cod again and can't believe his luck.Justin figured that the fish could change him back into a prawn.  He begs the cod to change him back so, lo and behold; he is turned back into a prawn.  With tears of joy in his tiny little eyes, Justin swam back to his friends and bought them all a cocktail. (The punch line does not involve a prawn cocktail - it's much worse).Looking around the gathering at the reef, he searched for his old pal. ""Where's Christian?"" he asked. ""He's at   home, distraught that his best friend changed sides to the enemy and became a shark"", came the reply.Eager to put things right again and end the mutual pain and torture, he set off to Christian's house.

"One day a horse and a chicken were walking along on the farm, talking quietly to themselves. All of a sudden, the horse falls into a hole that he didn't see. 

The horse says to the chicken, ""Go get the farmer. He'll know what to do."" So, the chicken runs off.

About 10 minutes later, the horse hears a car, and he sees the chicken's head peer over the top of the hole. The chicken says, ""I couldn't find the farmer, but I got his car. Hold this rope, and I'll try to drag you out."" So, after a few minutes, the horse was safely out of the hole.

About a month later, both had forgotten all about the hole. They were once again talking and walking about the farm, when all of a sudden, the chicken falls into the same hole. The chicken says to the horse, ""Go get the farmer; he'll know what to do."" 

But the horse walks around the hole and says, ""I think I can stand over the hole. Grab my thingy, and I'll pull you out."" And so, about 5 minutes later, the chicken was safely out of the hole.

"Little Leroy went to his mother demanding a new bicycle. His Mother decided that he should take a look at himself and the way he acts. She said, ""Well, Leroy, it isn't Christmas and we don't have the money to just go out and buy you anything you want. Why don't you write a letter to Jesus and pray for one instead?""

After Leroy threw a temper tantrum, his mother sent him to his room, where he finally sat down to write a letter to Jesus.

Dear Jesus, I've been a good boy this year and would appreciate a new bicycle. Your friend, Leroy.

Now, Leroy knew that Jesus really understood what kind of boy he was - a brat - so Leroy ripped up the letter and decided to give it another try.

Dear Jesus, I've been an OK boy this year, and I want a new bicycle. Yours truly, Leroy

Well, Leroy knew this wasn't totally honest either, so he tore it up and tried again.

Dear Jesus, I've thought about being a good boy this year, and can I have a bicycle? Leroy

Leroy looked deep down into his heart (which, by the way, was what his mother really wanted). He knew he had been terrible and was deserving of almost nothing.

"1 star hangover * - No pain.  No real feeling of illness. You slept in your own bed and when you woke up there were no traffic cones in there with you.  You are still able to function relatively well on the energy stored up from all those vodka red bulls. However, you can drink 10 bottles of water and still feel as parched as the Sahara. Even vegetarians are craving a Cheeseburger and a side of fries.2 star hangover * * - No pain, but something is definitely amiss. You may look okay but you have the attention span and mental capacity of a stapler.   The coffee you hug to try and remain focused is only exacerbating your rumbling gut, which is craving a full English breakfast. Although you have a nice demeanour about the office, you are costing your employer valuable money because all you really can handle is some light filing, followed byaimlessly surfing the net and writing junk e-mails.3 star hangover * * * - Slight headache. Stomach feels crap. You are definitely a space cadet and not so productive. Anytime a girl or lad walks by you gag because her perfume / aftershave reminds you of the random gin shots you did with your alcoholic friends, after the bouncer kicked you out at 1:45 a.m. Life would be better right now if you were in your bed with a dozen doughnuts and a litre of coke watching daytime TV. You've had 4 cups of coffee, a gallon of water, 2 Sausage Rolls and a litre of diet coke yet you haven't peed once.4 star hangover * * * * - You have lost the will to live. Your head is throbbing and you can't speak too quickly or else you might spew. Your boss has already lambasted you for being late and has given you a lecture for reeking of booze. You wore nice clothes, but you smell of socks, and you can't hide the fact that you either missed an oh-so crucial spot shaving or it looks like you put your make-up on while riding the dodgemsdepending on your gender. Your teeth have their own individual sweaters. Your eyeslook like one big vein and your hairstyle makes you look like a reject from the second-grade class picture circa 1976. You would give a week's pay for one of the following:Home time, doughnut and somewhere to be alone, or a Time machine so you could go back and NOT have gone out the night before. You scare small children in the street just by walking past them.5 star hangover * * * * * - You have a second heartbeat in your head, which is actually annoying the employee who sits next to you. Vodka vapour is seeping out of every pore and making you dizzy. You still have toothpaste crust in the corners of your mouth from brushing your teeth. Your body has lost the ability to generate saliva, so your tongue is suffocating you. You'd cry but that would take the last of the moisture left in your body.    Death seems pretty good right now. Your boss doesn't even get mad at you and your co-workers think that your dog just died because you look so pathetic.   You should have called in sick because, let's face it, all you can manage to do is breathe ... very gently.6 star hangover * * * * * * - You arrive home and climb into bed. Sleep comes instantly; as you were fighting it all the way home in the taxi.  You get about 2 hours sleep until the noises inside your head wake you up.  You notice that your bed has been cleared for take off and is flying relentlessly around the room. No matter what you do you now, you're going to chuck. You stumble out of bed and now find that your room is in ayacht under full sail. After walking along the skirting boards on alternating walls knocking off all the pictures, you find the toilet. If you are lucky you will remember to lift the lid before you spontaneously explode and wake the whole house up with your impersonation of walrus mating calls. You sit there on the floor in your undies, cuddling the only friend in the world you have left (the toilet), randomly continuing to make the walrus noises, spitting, and farting.  Help usually comes at this stage, even if it is short lived. Tears stream down your face and your abdomen hurts. Help now turns into abuse and he/she usually goes back to bed leaving you there in the dark. With your stomach totally empty, your spontaneous eruptions have died back to 15-minute intervals, but your body won't relent. You are convinced that you are starting to turn yourself inside out and swear that you saw your tonsils projectile out your mouth on the last occasion. It is now dawn and you pass your disgusted partner getting up for the day as you try to climb into bed.

"Once upon a time there lived a woman who had a maddening passion for baked beans. She loved them but unfortunately they had always had a very embarrassing and somewhat lively reaction to her. Then one day she met a guy and fell in love. When it became apparent that they would marry she thought to herself, "" He is such a sweet and gentle man, he would never go for this carrying on."" So she made the supreme sacrifice and gave up beans. Some months later her car broke down on the way home from work. Since she lived in the country she called her husband and told him that she would be late because she had to walk home. On her way she passed a small diner and the odor of the baked beans was more than she could stand. Since she still had miles to walk, she figured that she would walk off any ill effects by the time she reached home. So, she stopped at the diner and before she knew it, she had consumed three large orders of baked beans. All the way home she putt-putted. And upon arriving home she felt reasonably sure she could control it. Her husband seemed excited to see her and exclaimed delightedly, ""Darling, I have a surprise for dinner tonight."" He then blindfolded her and led her to her chair at the table. She seated herself and just as he was about to remove the blindfold from his wife, the telephone rang. He made her promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned. He then went to answer the phone. The baked beans she had consumed were still affecting her and the pressure was becoming almost unbearable, so while her husband was out of the room she seized the opportunity, shifted her weight to one leg and let it go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of pulpwood mill. She took her napkin and fanned the air around her vigorously. Then, she shifted to the other cheek and ripped three more, which reminded her of cabbage cooking. Keeping her ears tuned to the conversation in the other room, she went on like this for another ten minutes. When the phone farewells signaled the end of her freedom, she fanned the air a few more times with her napkin, placed it on her lap and folded her hands upon it, smiling contentedly to herself. She was the picture of innocence when her husband returned, Apologizing for taking so long, he asked her if she peeked, and she assured him that she had not. At this point, he removed the blindfold, and she was surprised!!! There were twelve dinner guests seated around the table to wish her a Happy Birthday!!!","Love & Romance",1059,4

next day the kids came back and one by one began to tell their stories.
Ashley said, ""My father's a farmer and we have a lot of egg laying  hens.
One time we were taking our eggs to market in a basket on the front seat 
of the car when we hit a big bump in the road and all the eggs went flying 
and broke and made a mess.""
""What's the moral of the story?"" asked the teacher.
""Don't put all your eggs in one basket!""
""Very good,"" said the teacher.

Next little Sarah raised her hand and said, ""Our family are farmers too.
But we raise chickens for the meat market. We had a dozen eggs one time,
but when they hatched we only got ten live chicks, and the moral to this
story is, ""don't count your chickens before they're hatched.""
""That was a fine story Sarah. Michael, do you have a story to share?""
Yes, my daddy told me this story about my Uncle Mike. Uncle Mike was a flight engineer in the Gulf War and his plane got hit. He had to bail out over enemy territory and all he had was a bottle of whiskey, a machine 
 gun and a machete. He drank the whiskey on the way down so it wouldn't break and then he landed right in the middle of 100 enemy troops. He killed seventy of them with the machine gun until he ran out of bullets. Then he killed twenty more with the machete until the blade broke. And then he
killed the last ten with his bare hands.""

Good heavens,"" said the horrified teacher, ""what kind of moral did your 
daddy tell you from that horrible story?"" ""Stay the hell away from Uncle Mike when he's been drinking.""","Aviation",1062,4.83

"Q: I've heard that cardiovascular exercise can prolong life. Is this true?

A: Your heart is only good for so many beats, and that's it... don't waste them on exercise. Everything wears out eventually. Speeding up your heart will not make you live longer; that's like saying you can extend the life of your car by driving it faster. Want to live longer? Take a nap.

Q: Should I cut down on meat and eat more fruits and vegetables?

A: You must grasp logistical efficiencies. What does a cow eat?  Hay and corn. And what are these?vegetables. So a steak is nothing more than an efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your system. Need grain? Eat chicken. Beef is also a good source of field grass (green leafy vegetable).  And a pork chop can give you 100% of your recommended daily
allowance of vegetable slop. 

Q: Is beer or wine bad for me?

A: Look, it goes to the earlier point about fruits and vegetables.  As we all know, scientists divide everything in the world into three categories: animal,
mineral, and vegetable. We all know that beer and wine are not animal, and they are not on the periodic table
of elements, so that only leaves one thing, right? My advice: Have a burger
and a beer and enjoy your liquid vegetables.

Q: How can I calculate my body/fat ratio?

A: Well, if you have a body, and you have body fat, your ratio is one to one. If you have two bodies, your
ratio is two to one, etc.

Q: What are some of the advantages of participating in a regular exercise program?

A: Can't think of a single one, sorry. My philosophy is: No Pain - Good.

Q: If I stop smoking, will I live longer?

A: Nope. Smoking is a sign of individual statement and peace of mind. If you stop, you'll probably stress
yourself to death in record time.

Q: Aren't fried foods bad for you?

A: You're not listening. Foods are fried these days in vegetable oil. In fact, they're permeated in it. How
could getting more vegetables be bad for you?

Q: What's the secret to healthy eating?

A: Thicker gravy.

Q: Will sit-ups help prevent me from getting a little soft around the middle?

A: Definitely not! When you exercise a muscle, it gets bigger.  You should only be doing sit-ups if you want
a bigger stomach.

Q: Is chocolate bad for me?

A: Are you crazy? Cocoa beans... Another vegetable. It's the best feel good food around!

The mechanic says he has a few others to look at first but if he comes back in an hour he can tell the penguin what is wrong with his car. The penguin agrees and goes for a walk. He finds an ice cream shop and thinks a big bowl of vanilla ice cream will really hit the spot since he's a penguin and it's Arizona in the summer, after all. He sits down at the counter and starts in on his ice cream. Of course he has no hands so it is rather messy. By the time he is done he has ice cream all over his flippers and his mouth - a total mess.

"We've all been there but don't like to admit it. We've all kicked back in our cubicles and suddenly felt something brew down below. As much as we try to convince ourselves otherwise, the WORK POOP is inevitable. For those who hate pooping at work, following is the 2001 Survival Guide for taking a dump at work. Memorize these definitions and pooping at work will become a pure pleasure.ESCAPEE.Definition: a fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or forcing a poop in a stall. This is usually accompanied by a sudden wave of panic embarrassment. This is similar to the hot flash you receive when passing an unseen police car and speeding. If you release an escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen. If you are standing next to the farter in the urinal, pretend you did not hear it. No one likes an escapee, it is uncomfortable for all involved. Making a joke or laughing makes both parties feel uneasy.JAILBREAK (Used in conjunction with ESCAPEE).Definition: When forcing poop, several farts slip out at a machine gun pace. This is usually a side effect of diarrhea or a hangover. If this should happen, do not panic. Remain in the stall until everyone has left the bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred.COURTESY FLUSH.Definition: The act of flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of the poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an undisclosed location. This reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink up the bathroom. This can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF SHAME.WALK OF SHAME.Definition: Walking from the stall, to the sink, to the door after you have just stunk up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone walks in and busts you. As with all farts, it is best to pretend that the smell does not exist. Can be avoided with the use of the COURTESY FLUSH.OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER.Definition: A colleague who poops at work and damn proud of it. You will often see an Out Of The Closet Pooper enter the bathroom with a newspaper or magazine under their arm. Always look around the office for the Out Of The Closet Pooper before entering the bathroom.THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (PFN).Definition: A group of coworkers who band together to ensure emergency pooping goes off without incident. This group can help you to monitor the whereabouts of Out Of The Closet Poopers, and identify SAFE HAVENS.SAFE HAVENS.Definition: A seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where you can least expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the opposite sex. This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the bathroom.TURD BURGLAR:Definition: A pooper who does not realize that you are in the stall and tries to force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and vulnerable moments that can occur when taking a dump at work. If this occurs, remain in the stall until the Turd Burglar leaves. This way you will avoid all uncomfortable eye contact.CAMO-COUGH.Definition: A phony cough that alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that you are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a WATERMELON, or to alert potential Turd Burglars. Very effective when used in conjunction with an ASTAIRE.ASTAIRE.Definition: A subtle toe-tap that is used to alert potential Turd Burglars that you are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt that the stall is occupied. If you hear an Astaire, leave the bathroom immediately so the pooper can poop in peace.WATERMELON.Definition: A turd that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet water. This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a Watermelon coming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH.HAVANA OMELET.Definition: A load of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes in the toilet water. Often accompanied by an Escapee. Try using a Camo-Cough with an Astaire.UNCLE TED.Definition: A bathroom user who seems to linger around forever. Could spend extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the pot. An Uncle Ted makes it difficult to relax while on the crapper, as you should always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is empty. This benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees.FLY BY.Definition: The act of scouting out a bathroom before pooping. Walk in and check for other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and come back again. Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER. People may become suspicious if they catch you constantly going into the bathroom.","Bar Jokes",1110,3.5

"As he was quietly watching television at home, the chap heard a sound on the roof of his house and rushed out to investigate. Seeing it was a fair-sized gorilla tearing the shingles off his home, he promptly called up the local zoo authorities to inform them one of their animals had escaped. He was reassured that a gorilla recovering units was on the way and to remain calm. A few minutes later, an old beat up truck, displaying the Gorilla recovery unit logo on its panels, pulled up to the house. The elderly driver proceeds to recover from the back of the truck, a chihuahua dog, a pair of handcuffs, a ladder, a baseball bat, and a 12-gauge shotgun. Puzzled on how this lone elderly was to solve the problem of this gorilla that had by now torn half the roof apart, the chap asked him how he would go about doing this. As he handed him over the 12-gauge shotgun, the zoo employee explained the plan: ""First I'll climb up there with the ladder. Then I'll approach the gorilla and knock him off the roof using the baseball bat. As soon as the gorilla hits the ground, the specially trained chihuahua will attack its private parts. When I get back on the ground, the gorilla will have lowered its hands to its groin area to protect itself thus making it easy for me to slip on the handcuffs. Then, I lead him to the truck, lock him up and take him back to the zoo..."" Amazed at the procedure, the somewhat startled house owner asked why he was handed the 12-gauge shotgun? ""Well,"" explained the experienced gorilla retriever, ""It's just a precaution should things not go exactly as planned. In the unlikely event that once on the roof, the gorilla knocks me off with the baseball, shoot the dog."".","Sports",1116,3

Rather than taking the final then, they decided to find their professor after the final and explain to him why they missed it.

The professor thought it over and then agreed they could make up the final the following day. The guys were elated and relieved. They studied that night and went in the next day at the time the professor had told them. He placed them in separate rooms and handed each of them a test booklet, and told them to begin. 

They looked at the first problem, worth five points. It was something simple about free radical formation. ""Cool,"" they thought at the same time, each one in his separate room, ""this is going to be easy."" Each finished the problem and then turned the page. 

On the second page was written: (For 95 points): Which tire?","School",1120,4
"Four men were bragging about how smart their dogs are. The first man was an Engineer, the second was an Accountant, the third was a Chemist, and the fourth man was a Government Worker. To show off, the Engineer called to his dog. ""T-Square, do your stuff."" T-Square trotted over to a desk, took out some paper and a pen and promptly drew a circle, a square, and a triangle. Everyone agreed that was pretty smart. 

The Accountant said his dog could do better, and said, ""Slide Rule, do your stuff."" Slide Rule went out into the kitchen and returned with a dozen cookies. He divided them into 4 equal piles of 3 cookies each. Everyone agreed that was good. 

The Chemist said his dog could do better still, so he called his dog and said, ""Measure, do your stuff."" Measure got up, walked over to the fridge, took out a quart of milk, got a 10 ounce glass from the cupboard and poured exactly 8 ounces without spilling a drop. Everyone agreed that was great. 

The Government Worker called to his dog and said, ""Coffee Break, do your stuff!"" Coffee Break jumped to his feet, ate the cookies, drank the milk, dumped on the paper, sexually assaulted the other three dogs, claimed he injured his back while doing so, filed a grievance for unsafe working conditions, put in for Workers Compensation and went home on sick leave.

"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of the world-famous detective, Sherlock Holmes, was not above telling tales about himself in which he was the laughing-stock. Here is one of those stories. As he tells it, he was waiting at a taxi- stand outside the railway station in Paris. When a taxi pulled up,he put his suitcase in it and got in himself. As he was about to tell the taxi-driver where he wanted to go, the driver asked him: ""Where can I take you, Mr. Doyle?"" Doyle was flabbergasted. He asked the driver whether he knew him by sight. The driver said: ""No Sir, I have never seen you before.'' The puzzled Doyle asked him what made him think that he was Conan Doyle. The driver replied: ""This morning's paper had a story about you being on vacation in Marseilles. This is the taxi-stand where people who return from Marseilles always come to. Your skin colour tells me you have been on vacation. The ink-spot on your right index finger suggests to me that you are a writer. Your clothing is very English, and not French. Adding up all those pieces of information, I deduce that you are Sir Arthur Conan Doyle."" Doyle said: ""This is truly amazing. You are a real-life counter-part to my fictional creation, Sherlock Holmes."" ""There is one other thing,"" the driver said. ""What is that?"" ""Your name is on the front of your suitcase."".","Miscellaneous",1123,2.67

"About a century or two ago, the Pope challenged the Jewish community of Rome to a debate.

The Jews looked around for a champion who could defend their faith, but no one wanted to volunteer. It was too risky. So they finally picked an old man named Moishe who spent his life sweeping up after people to represent them. Being old and poor, he had less to lose, so he agreed. He asked only for one addition to the rules of debate. Not being used to saying very much, he asked that neither side be allowed to talk. The Pope agreed.

The day of the great debate came. Moishe and the Pope sat opposite each other for a full minute before the Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. Moishe looked back at him and raised one finger. The Pope waved his fingers in a circle around his head. Moishe pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope pulled out a wafer and a glass of wine. Moishe pulled out an apple. The Pope stood up and said, ""I give up. This man is too good. The Jews win.""

An hour later, the cardinals were all around the Pope asking him what happened. The Pope said, ""First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up one finger, to remind me that there was still one God common to both our religions. Then I waved my finger around me to show him, that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground, showing that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine and the wafer to show that God absolves us from our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of original sin. He had an answer for everything. What could I do?""

Meanwhile, the Jewish community had crowded around Moishe, amazed that this old, almost feeble-minded man had done what all their scholars had insisted was impossible. ""What happened?"" they asked.

""Well,"" said Moishe, ""first he said to me that the Jews had three days to get out of here. I told him that not one of us was leaving. Then he told me that this whole city would be cleared of Jews. I let him know that we were staying right here.""

""And then?"" asked a woman.

"A burglar was cruising through a posh suburb looking for an opportunity. At one house he saw a truck unloading a big screen television, stereo, and video outfit. That night, without a moon in the sky and a heavy fog, he drove up to the house. He rang the doorbell and when no one answered, broke the lock on the kitchen door and went in.It was pitch black inside as he made his way through the kitchen, then the dining room and into the den where he expected to find the things he wanted to steal. ""I see you and Jesus sees you,"" a voice said. The burglar froze in his tracks.""I see you and Jesus sees you,"" the voice said again.When nothing more happened, the burglar took out his flashlight and shined it in the direction of the voice.

"An engineer died and ended up in Hell. Soon, he became dissatisfied with the level of comfort in Hell, and began designing and building improvements. After a while, they had flush toilets, air conditioning, escalators. The engineer was a pretty popular guy.One day God called to Satan and said with a sneer, ""So, how's it going down there in Hell?"" Satan replied, ""Hey, things are great. We've got air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators, and there's no telling what this engineer is going to come up with next.""God exclaimed, ""What? You've got an engineer? That's a mistake--he should never have gotten down there in the first place. Send him back up here.""""No way,"" replied Satan.

"Continuing the current trend of large-scale mergers and acquisitions, it was announced today at a press conference that Christmas and Hanukkah will merge. An industry source said that the deal had been in the works about 1300 years. While details were not available at press time, it is believed that the overhead cost of having twelve days of Christmas and eight days of Hanukkah was becoming prohibitive for both sides. By combining forces, we're told, the world will be able to enjoy consistently high-quality service during the Fifteen Days of Chrismukah, as the new holiday is being called.

Massive layoffs are expected, with lords a-leaping and maids a-milking being the hardest hit. As part of the conditions of the agreement, the letters on the dreidel, currently in Hebrew, will be replaced by Latin, thus becoming unintelligible to a wider audience.

Also, instead of translating to ""A great miracle happened there,"" the message on the dreidel will be the more generic: ""Miraculous stuff happens."" In exchange, it is believed that Jews will be allowed to use Santa Claus and his vast merchandising resources for buying and delivering their gifts.

One of the sticking points holding up the agreement for at least three hundred years was the question of whether Jewish children could leave milk and cookies for Santa even after having eaten meat for dinner. A breakthrough came last year, when Oreos were finally declared to be Kosher. All sides appeared happy about this.

Fortunately for all concerned, he said, Kwanzaa will help to maintain the competitive balance. He then closed the press conference by leading all present in a rousing rendition of ""Oy Vey, All Ye Faithful.""","Religious",1195,1

In response to Bills comment, General Motors issued A press release making the following statement: ""If we (GM) had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving cars with the following characteristics:

1) for no reson whatsoever, your car would crash twice per day.
2) Every time they repainted the lines in the road, you would have to buy a new car.
3) Your car would occasionally stop on the freeway without reason. In order to get started again, you would have to pull off to the side of the road, close all the windowsshut off the car resart it and open all the windows again. For some unknown reason, you would simply do this without question.
4) Occasionally, executing a maneuver, such as a left turn, would cause your car to shut down and refuse to resart, in which case you would have to reinstall the engine.
5) Only one person could use the car at one time unless you bought ""Car95"" or ""CarNT"", but then you would also have to buy more seats.
6) The new seats you would need would force everyone to have the same size butt.
7) You would press the ""start"" button to shut off the engine.
8) The oil warning light, water warning light, and alternator warning light would all be replaced by a single ""Unidentified System Error"" light.
9) The air bag would ask ur freshly mangled body ""are you sure"" before going off.
10) Occasionally, for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and refuse to let you back inuntill you simultaneously lifted the driver side door handle, turned the key, and grabbed the radio antenna.
11) The radio antenna would be internally mounted on the passenger side of the car.
12) buying a new car would force you to also purchase a new set of Deluxe Rand McNally road maps, dispite the fact that you niether need nor want them. Attempting to delet this otion would immediately cause your cars performance to diminish by 50% or more.
13) every time GM introduced a new car, people would have to learn to drive all over again because none of the old controls would function in the new car.
14) Macintosh would make a car that was five times faster, ten times more reliable and easier to mantain, twice as easy to drive, but would only run on five percent of the roads.""","Computers",1213,4.86

Not something you did to a file 
And if you unzipped anything in public 
You'd be in jail for a while! 

Log on was adding wood to a fire 
Hard drive was a long trip on the road 
A mouse pad was where a mouse lived 
And a backup happened to your commode! 

Cut - you did with a pocket knife 
Paste you did with glue 
A web was a spider's home 
And a virus was the flu! 

I guess I'll stick to my pad and paper 
And the memory in my head 
I hear nobody's been killed in a computer crash 
But when it happens they wish they were dead!","Computers",1216,3.67
"This memo is to announce the development of a new software system which will be Year 2000 compliant. This program is known as ""Millennia Year Application Software System"" (MYASS). 
Next Monday there will be a meeting in which I will show MYASS to everyone. We will hold demonstrations throughout the month so that all employees will have an opportunity to get a good look at MYASS. We have not addressed networking aspects yet, so currently only one person at a time can use MYASS. This restriction will be removed after MYASS expands. 

Some employees have begun using the program already. This morning I walked into a subordinate's office and was not surprised to find that he had his nose buried in MYASS. Some of the less technical people may be somewhat afraid of MYASS. Last week my secretary said to me, ""I'm a little nervous, I never put anything in MYASS before."" I helped her through the first time and afterward she admitted that it was relatively painless and she was actually looking forward to doing it again, and was even ready to kiss MYASS. 

There have been concerns over the virus that was found in MYASS upon initial installation, but the virus has been eliminated and we were able to save MYASS. In the future, however, protection will be required prior to entering MYASS. This database will encompass all information associated with the business. 

As you begin using the program, feel free to put anything you want in MYASS. As MYASS grows larger, we envision a time when it will be commonplace for a supervisor to hand work to an employee and say, ""here, stick this in MYASS."" It will be a great day when we need data quickly and our employees can respond, ""Here it is, I just pulled it out of MYASS.""","Computers",1217,3.33
"Recently a teacher, a garbage collector, and a lawyer wound up together at the Pearly Gates. St. Peter informed them that in order to get into Heaven, they would each have to answer one question. St. Peter addressed the teacher and asked, ""What was the name of the ship that crashed into the iceberg? They just made a movie about it."" The teacher answered quickly, ""That would be the Titanic."" St. Peter let him through the gate. St. Peter turned to the garbage man and, figuring Heaven didn't REALLY need all the odors that this guy would bring with him, decided to make the question a little harder: ""How many people died on the ship?"" Fortunately for him, the trash man had just seen the movie and answered, ""about 1,500."" ""That's right! You may enter."" St. Peter then turned to the lawyer. ""Name them.""","Lawyers",1218,3.67
"A big-city California lawyer went duck hunting in rural Texas. He shot and dropped a bird, but it fell into a farmer's field on the other side of a fence. As the lawyer climbed over the fence, an elderly farmer drove up on his tractor and asked him what he was doing. The litigator responded, ""I shot a duck and it fell into this field, and now I'm going to retrieve it."" The old farmer replied, ""This is my property, and you are not coming over here."" The indignant lawyer said, ""I am one of the best trial attorneys in the U.S. and, if you don't let me get that duck, I'll sue you and take everything you own."" The old farmer smiled and said, ""Apparently, you don't know how we do things in Texas. We settle small disagreements like this with the Texas Three-Kick-Rule."" The lawyer asked, What is the Texas Three-Kick-Rule?."" The farmer replied, ""Well, first I kick you three times and then you kick me three times, and so on, back and forth, until someone gives up."" The attorney quickly thought about the proposed contest and decided that he could easily take the old codger. He agreed to abide by the local custom. The old farmer slowly climbed down from the tractor and walked up to the city feller. His first kick planted the toe of his heavy work boot into the lawyer's groin and dropped him to his knees. His second kick nearly wiped the man's nose off his face. The barrister was flat on this belly when the farmer's third kick to a kidney nearly caused him to give up. The lawyer summoned every bit of his will and managed to get to his feet and said, ""OK, you old coot! now, it's my turn."" The old farmer smiled and said, ""No I give up, you can have the duck.","Lawyers",1219,3

"A trial had been scheduled in a small town, but the court clerk had forgotten to call in a jury panel. Rather than adjourning what he thought was an exceptionally simple case, the judge ordered his bailiff to go through the courthouse and round up enough people to form a jury. The bailiff returned with a group of lawyers.The prosecutor felt that it would be an interesting experiment to try a case before a jury of lawyers, and the defense counsel had no objection, so a jury was impaneled. And the trial went very quickly -- after only an hour of testimony, and very short closing arguments, both sides rested. The jury was then instructed by the judge, and was sent back to the jury room to deliberate.After nearly six hours, the trial court was concerned that the jury had not returned with a verdict. The case had in fact turned out to be every bit as simple as he had expected, and it seemed to him that they should have been back in minutes. He sent the bailiff to the jury room, to see if they needed anything.The bailiff returned, and the judge asked, ""Are they close to reaching a verdict?""

The Doctor, moved by the gentle Clergymans sincerity, confessed that he too had kept some of the money for a worthy medical charity. The envelope, he admitted, had only $8000 in it. He said, he too could not bring himself to waste the money so frivolously when it could be used to benefit others.By this time the Lawyer was seething with self-righteous outrage. He expressed his deep disappointment in the felonious behavior of two of his oldest and most trusted friends. ""I am the only one who kept his promise to our dying friend. I want you both to know that the envelope I placed in the coffin contained the full amount. Indeed, my envelope contained my personal check for the entire $25,000.""","Lawyers",1250,5

"A little boy wanted $100 badly and prayed for two weeks but nothing happened. Then he decided to write God a letter requesting the $100. When the postal authorities received the letter addressed to God, USA, they decided to send it to President Bush. The President was so impressed, touched, and amused that he instructed his secretary to send the little boy a $5.00 bill. President Bush thought this would appear to be a lot of money to a little boy. The little boy was delighted with the $5.00 and sat down to write a thank you note to God, which read: Dear God, Thank you very much for sending the money, however, I noticed that for some reason you had to send it through Washington D.C. and, as usual, those crooks deducted $95.00.","Political",1330,5
"Einstein dies and goes to heaven. At the Pearly Gates, Saint Peter tells him, ""You look like Einstein, but you have NO idea the lengths that some people will go to sneak into Heaven. Can you prove who you really are?"" 

Einstein ponders for a few seconds and asks, ""Could I have a blackboard and some chalk?"" 

Saint Peter snaps his fingers and a blackboard and chalk instantly appear. Einstein proceeds to describe with arcane mathematics and symbols his theory of relativity. 

Saint Peter is suitably impressed. ""You really ARE Einstein!"" he says. ""Welcome to heaven!"" 

The next to arrive is Picasso. Once again, Saint Peter asks for credentials. 

Picasso asks, ""Mind if I use that blackboard and chalk?"" 

Saint Peter says, ""Go ahead."" 

Picasso erases Einstein's equations and sketches a truly stunning mural with just a few strokes of chalk. 

Saint Peter claps. ""Surely you are the great artist you claim to be!"" he says. ""Come on in!"" 

Then Saint Peter looks up and sees George W. Bush. Saint Peter scratches his head and says, ""Einstein and Picasso both managed to prove their identity. How can you prove yours?"" 

George W. looks bewildered and says, ""Who are Einstein and Picasso?"" 

Saint Peter sighs and says, ""Come on in, George.""","Political",1331,4

The clerk replies, ""Well, he came in here this morning to get something for his cough. I couldn't find the cough syrup, so I gave him an entire bottle of laxative"".

The owner yells, ""You idiot! You can't treat a cough with a bottle of laxatives""!

"Four expectant fathers were in a Minneapolis hospital waiting room while their wives were in labor. The nurse arrived and proudly announced to the first man, ""Congratulations, sir. You're the father of twins!""

""What a coincidence! I work for the Minnesota Twins Baseball team!""

Later the nurse returned and congratulated the second father on the birth of his triplets.

""Wow! That's incredible! I work for the 3M Corporation.""

An hour later, the nurse returned to congratulate the third man on the birth of his quadruplets. Stunned, he barely could reply, ""I don't believe it! I work for the Four Seasons Hotel!""

After this, everyone turned to the fourth guy who had just fainted. The nurse rushed to his side. As he slowly gained consciousness, they could hear him mutter over and over, ""I should never have taken that job at 7-Eleven. I should never have taken that job at 7-Eleven. I should never have taken that job....""","Family, Parents",1488,4
"The CEO of a Vacuum Cleaner company was impatient with the poor job his salespeople were doing, so one day he decided to do the job himself.

He pulled up to an old house in his Mercedes Benz and knocked on the door. A little old barefoot man wearing overalls answered the knock on the door, only to be confronted by the very well dressed and dignified CEO in a $2,000 navy blue pin-striped business suit, a Hermes silk tie, a starched white shirt with monogrammed cufflinks, $700 shoes polished like black mirrors, and carrying a vacuum cleaner.

""Good morning,"" said the well-dressed and impeccably groomed CEO. ""If I could take a couple minutes of your time, I would like to demonstrate the very latest in high-powered vacuum cleaners.""

""Get lost, Mister fancy suit!"" said the old man. ""I haven't got any money"" and he proceeded to close the door.

Quick as a flash, the CEO wedged his polished shoe in the door and pushed it wide open.

""Don't be too hasty!"" he said. ""Not until you have at least seen my demonstration.""

The old man again told him to get lost. And with that, the CEO emptied a bucket of mud all over his hallway carpet.

""If this vacuum cleaner does not remove all traces of this mess from your carpet, sir, I will personally eat the remainder. I am the CEO! You have my GUARANTEE!""

""I got a better idea"" said the old man, ""If you don't clean it all up, I'll swap those fancy clothes of yours fer my overalls. Your nice suit, your tie, your shoes, everything!""

""Fine, sir!"" said the CEO confidently. ""I'll give you my clothes!""

""Lemme ask you somethin', pal...Where are you goin' when you leave here?""

The CEO answered very confidently: ""To a VERY important conference! WHY?""

""Will they let you in if yer barefoot?"" said the old man.

""Of course not!"" said the CEO.

""How much did you pay for those socks you'v got on?"" asked the old man.

""Fifty dollars"" said the bewildered CEO.

""I ain't never worn fifty dollar socks before!"" said the old man. ""It will be kinda hard for you to wear overalls to work, I guess!"" said the old man.

""WHAT?!"" said the confused CEO.

""And will you show how me to tie a necktie?"" said the old man...

One hour later, the door of the apartment opened, and the CEO carefully looked out. Seeing that no one was around, his foot appeared.

A bare foot.

He stepped out into the hallway - dressed only in overalls and bare feet. His expensive executive suit and tie had vanished, along with his confidence and dignity.

The old man watched him run away to his car with a grin, admiring the expensive pinstriped suit and silk tie he had just acquired. He then sat down and pulled on the CEO's fifty dollar socks and gleaming shoes.

""Now I gotta see about payin' that electric bill...""","Office Jokes",1489,5
"Two boys from the mountains, Leroy and Jasper have been promoted from privates to sergeants.

Not long after, they're out for a walk and Leroy says, ""Hey Jasper, there's the NCO Club. Let's you and me stop in.""

""But we's privates,"" protests Jasper.

""We's sergeants now, ""says Leroy, pulling him inside.

""Now, Jasper, I'm a-gonna sit down and have me a drink.""

""But we's privates,"" says Jasper. ""Are you blind, boy?"" asks Leroy, pointing at his stripes. ""We's sergeants now.""

So they have their drink, and pretty soon a hooker comes up to Leroy. ""You're cute,"" she says, ""and I'd like to date you, but I've got a bad case of gonorrhea.""

Leroy pulls his friend to the side and whispers, ""Jasper, go look in the dictionary and see what gonorrhea means. If it's okay, give me the okay sign."" So Jasper goes to look it up, comes back, and gives Leroy the big okay sign.

Three weeks later Leroy is laid up in the infirmary with a terrible case of gonorrhea. ""Jasper,"" he says, ""why did you give me the okay sign?""

""Well, Leroy, in the dictionary, it says gonorrhea affects only the privates."" He points to his stripes. ""But we's sergeants now!""","Idiots",1490,3

"Stage 1 - SMART  This is when you suddenly become an expert on every subject in the known Universe. You know you know everything and want to pass on your knowledge to anyone who will listen. At this stage you are always RIGHT. And of course the person you are talking to is very WRONG. This makes for an interesting argument when both parties are SMART. Stage 2 - GOOD LOOKING  This is when you realise that you are the BEST LOOKING person in the entire bar and that people fancy you. You can go up to a perfect stranger knowing they fancy you and really want to talk to you. Bear in mind that you are still SMART, so you can talk to this person about any subject under the sun. Stage 3 - RICH  This is when you suddenly become the richest person in the world. You can buy drinks for the entire bar because you have an armoured truck full of money parked behind the bar. You can also make bets at this stage, because of course, you are still SMART, so naturally you win all your bets. It doesn't matter how much you bet 'cos you are RICH.  You will also buy drinks for everyone that you fancy, because now you are the BEST LOOKING person in the world. Stage 4 - BULLET PROOF  You are now ready to pick fights with anyone and everyone especially those with whom you have been betting or arguing. This is because nothing can hurt you. At this point you can also go up to the partners of the people who you fancy and challenge to a battle of wits or money. You have no fear of losing this battle because you are SMART, you are RICH and hell, you're BETTER LOOKING than they are anyway! Stage 5 - INVISIBLE  This is the Final Stage of Drunkenness. At this point you can do anything because NO ONE CAN SEE YOU. You dance on a table to impress the people who you fancy because the rest of the people in the room cannot see you. You are also invisible to the person who wants to fight you. You can walk through the street singing at the top of your lungs because no one can see or hear you and because you're still SMART you know all the words.","Money",1754,3

"My uncle was in the fertilized egg business when I was young. He had several hundred young layers, called pullets, and 8 or 10 roosters whose job was to fertilize the eggs.My uncle kept records and any rooster or pullet that didn't perform well went into the pot and was replaced. Now this took an awful lot of time. So when my uncle saw a set of eight tiny bells that each rang a different tone he promptly bought them.He glued a piece of foam rubber to each clapper shaft so the bell wouldn't ring except when violently shaken. He hung a bell on each rooster's neck and went and mixed a Mint Julep. Now he could sit on the porch and sip while filling out an efficiency report on the roosters by listening to the different tones of the bells and marking down each encounter. My uncle's favorite rooster was old Brewster. Brewster was a fine specimen, but his bell didn't ring all morning. Uncle went to investigate.Several roosters were chasing pullets, bells a-ringing. Brewster had his bell in his beak so it couldn't ring. He'd sneak up on a pullet, do his job and walk on to the next one. Chagrined at first, Uncle was soon so proud of Brewster he entered him in the county fair.Brewster was an overnight sensation.

Unfortunately, no Trids were Jewish, so they wrote to the people of another land and asked them to send a Rabbi to help them with the ogre.The Rabbi arrived and led a delegation of Trids up the mountain.The ogre saw them coming and kicked all of them, except for the Rabbi, down the mountain.The Rabbi, having been told of the previous expeditions, wondered why he alone had not been kicked down the mountain, so he asked the ogre.The ogre laughed and replied:""Silly Rabbi, kicks are for Trids!""","Religious",1931,4

"Here are a few new perspectives through which to look at life!1. Follow your dream!Unless it's the one where you're at work in your underwear during a fire drill.2. Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead.Do not walk ahead of me, for Imay not follow.Do not walk beside me, either.Just leave me alone.3. If you don't like my driving, don't call anyone.Just take another road. That's why the highway department made so many of them.4. When I'm feeling down, I like to whistle. It makes the neighbor's dog run to the end of his chain and gag himself.5. It's always darkest before the dawn.So if you're going to steal the neighbor's newspaper, that's the time to do it.6. A handy telephone tip: Keep a small chalkboard near the phone. That way, when a salesman calls, you can hold the receiver up to it and run your fingernails across it until he hangs up.7. Each day I try to enjoy something from each of the four food groups the bonbon group, the salty-snack group, the caffeine group and the Whatever group.8. Into every life some rain must fall.Usually when your car windows are down.9. When you find yourself getting irritated with someone, try to remember that all men are brothers and just give them a noogie or an Indian burn. (try to avoid doing this to guys over 6'5"", because they can turn your body into an accordion Jershie :)10. This morning I woke up to the unmistakable scent of pigs in a blanket. That's the price you pay for letting your mother-in-law stay over.11. It's a small world.So you have to use your elbows a lot.12. Keep your nose to the grindstone and your shoulder to the wheel. It's a lot cheaper than plastic surgery.13. Love is like a roller coaster. When it's good you don't want to get off, and when it isn't, you can't wait to throw up.14. If you think nobody cares if you're alive, try missing a couple of car payments.15. If you lend someone $20, and never see that person again; it was probably worth it.","Crazy Jokes",1935,4.5

"Letter from Camp...
Dear Mom & Dad:We are having a great time here at Lake Typhoid. Scoutmaster Webb is making us all write to our parents in case you saw the flood on TV and worried. We are OK. Only 1 of our tents and 2 sleeping bags got washed away. Luckily, none of us got drowned because we were all up on the mountain looking for Chad when it happened. Oh yes, please call Chad's mother and tell her he is OK. He can't write because of the cast. I got to ride in one of the search & rescue jeeps. It was neat. We never would have found him in the dark if it hadn't been for the lightning.Scoutmster Webb got mad at Chad for going on a hike alone without telling anyone. Chad said he did tell him, but it was during the fire so he probably didn't hear him. Did you know that if you put gas on a fire, the gas can will blow up? The wet wood still didn't burn, but one of our tents did. Also some of our clothes. John is going to look weird until his hair grows back. We will be home on Saturday if Scoutmaster Webb gets the car fixed. It wasn't his fault about the wreck. The brakes worked OK when we left. Scoutmaster Webb said that a car that old you have to expect something to break down; that's probably why he can't get insurance on it. We think it's a neat car. He doesn't care if we get it dirty, and if its hot, sometimes he lets us ride on the tailgate. It gets pretty hot with 10 people in a car. He let us take turns riding in the trailer until the highway patrolman stopped and talked to us. Scoutmaster Webb is a neat guy. Don't worry, he is a good driver.In fact, he is teaching Terry how to drive. But he only lets him drive on the mountain roads where there isn't any traffic. All we ever see up there are logging trucks. This morning all of the guys were diving off the rocks and swimming out in the lake. Scoutmaster Webb wouldn't let me because I can't swim and Chad was afraid he would sink because of his cast, so he let us take the canoe across the lake. It was great. You can still see some of the trees under the water from the flood.Scoutmaster Webb isn't crabby like some scoutmasters. He didn't even get mad about the life jackets. He has to spend a lot of time working on the car so we are trying not to cause him any trouble. Guess what? We have all passed our firstaid merit badges. When Dave dove in the lake and cut his arm, we got to see how a tourniquet works. Also Wade and I threw up. Scoutmaster Webb said it probably was just food poisoning from the leftover chicken. I have to go now. We are going into town to mail our letters and buy bullets. Don't worry about anything. We are fine.Love,ColeP.S.

"The answer to the eternal question ""Is it better to be a jock or a nerd?Michael Jordan made over $300,000 a game. That equals $10,000 a minute, at an average of 30 minutes per game. With $40 million in endorsements, hemade $178,100 a day, working or not. If he sleeps 7 hours a night, he makes $52,000 every night while visions of sugarplums dance in his head. If he goes to see a movie, it'll cost him $7.00, but he'll make $18,550 while he's there. If he decides to have a 5 minute egg, he'll make $618 while boiling it. He makes $7,415/hr more than minimum wage. He'll make $3,710 while watching each episode of Friends. If he wanted to save up for a new Acura NSX ($90,000) it would take him a whole 12 hours. If someone were to hand him his salary and endorsement money, they would have to do it at the rate of $2.00 every second. He'll probably pay around $200 for a nice round of golf, but will be reimbursed $33,390 for that round. Assuming he puts the federal maximum of 15% of his income into a tax deferred account (401k), he will hit the federal cap of $9500 at 8:30 a.m. on January 1st. If you were given a penny for every 10 dollars he made, you 'd be living comfortably at $65,000 a year. He'll make about $19.60 while watching the 100 meter dash in the Olympics. He'll make about $15,600 during the Boston Marathon. While the common person is spending about $20 for a meal in his trendy Chicago restaurant, he'll pull in about $5600. In his last year, he made more than twice as much as all U.S. past presidents for all of their terms combined. Amazing isn't it?

The man looks over at him, smiles a small smile and nods his head. ""Yes, I am Jesus,"" he says. The Irishman calls the bartender over and says to him, ""I'd like you to give Jesus over there a pint of Guinness from me.""
So the bartender pours Jesus a Guinness and takes it over to his table. Jesus looks over, raises his glass, smiles thank you and drinks.
The Englishman then calls out, ""Er, excuse me Sir, but would you be Jesus?""
Jesus smiles and says, ""Yes, I am Jesus.""
The Englishman beckons the bartender and tells him to send over a pint of Newcastle Brown Ale for Jesus, which the bartender duly does as before. Jesus accepts the drink and smiles over at the men.
Then the Australian calls out, ""Oi, you! D'ya reckon you're Jesus, or what?""
Jesus nods and says, ""Yes, I am Jesus.""
The Australian is mighty impressed and has the bartender send over a schooner of VB for Jesus, which he accepts with pleasure.
Some time later, after finishing the drinks, Jesus leaves his seat and approaches the three men. He reaches for the hand of the Irishman and shakes it, thanking him for the Guinness. When he lets go, the Irishman gives a cry of amazement. ""Oh God, the arthritis is gone,"" he says. ""The arthritis I've had for years is gone. It's a miracle!""
Jesus then shakes the hand of the Englishman, thanking him for the NewcastleBrown Ale. Upon letting go, the Englishman's eyes widen in shock. ""By jove,""he exclaims, ""The migraine I've had for over 40 years is completely gone. It's a miracle!""
Jesus then approaches the Australian, who has a terrified look on his face.

"Halloween Party
A couple was invited to a masked Halloween Party. She got a terrible headache and told her husband to go to the party alone. He, being a devoted husband, protested, but she argued and said she was going to take some aspirin and go to bed, and there was no need of his good time being spoiled by not going. So he took his costume and away he went. 
The wife, after sleeping soundly for one hour, awakened without pain, and as it was still early, she decided to go to the party. In as much as her husband did not know what her costume was, she thought she would have some fun by watching her husband to see how he acted when she was not with him. She joined the party and soon spotted her husband cavorting around on the dance floor, dancing with every nice chick he could, and a little kiss here, a little kiss there and sometimes a little bit more. His wife sidled up to him and being a rather seductive woman herself, he left his partner high and dry and devoted his time to the new stuff that had just arrived. She let him go as far as he wished; naturally, since he was her husband. Finally he whispered a little proposition in her ear and she agreed, so off they went to one of the neighbouring rooms and did something which she would only allow her husband to do. She was quite upset afterwards because her husband could not know that she was his wife. She slipped away and went home and put the costume away and got into bed, wondering what kind of explanation he would make for his behaviour. She was sitting up reading when he came in and asked what kind of a time he had. He said, ""Oh, you know I never have a good time when you are not there."" Then she asked, ""Did you dance much?"" He replied, ""I did not dance at all. When I got there I met Pete, Bill, John and some other guys, so we went into the den and played poker all evening.

The priest, keeping watch at the side of his bed leaned quietly over and asked, ""Do you have something you would like to say?"" 

Fred nodded to the affirmative, and the priest handed him a pad and pen. ""I know you can't speak, but use this to write a note, and I will give it to your wife. She's waiting just outside.""

Gathering his last ounce of strength, Fred took them and scrawled his message upon the pad which he stuffed into the priest's hands. Then, moments later, he died.

The pastor thought it best not to look at the note just then, so he slipped it into his jacket pocket. After administering the last rites, the priest left to break the sad news to the wife.

Several days later, at the funeral, the pastor delivered the eulogy. He realized that he was wearing the same jacket that he'd worn the day Fred died.

"One day a man decides he wants to take up a new hobby. So he goes to a local sports shop and sees a duck hunting magazine and thinks to himself that it would be a challenge. So he goes out and buys all the stuff for duck hunting. The man goes to a remote area and lays his fake ducks out on the pond nearby. He hides in the tall grass and pulls out his duck whistle and starts blowing. All of a sudden there are dozens of ducks flying by and he starts to shoot at them. He does this several times that day. At the end of the day he feels good about his new hobby and starts to look for all the ducks that he shot down. 

After collecting all the ducks the man heads back to his car and out of nowhere a park ranger appears and says to the man ""hello sir, how are you doing today?"" The man says proudly, with his chest sticking out ""I'm doing great!! It's my first time duck hunting and if you don't mind me saying it was a real challenge, I was even able to bag quite a few ducks today!"" 

The ranger pauses and asks the man if he could see his duck hunting license. ""Sure no problem"" the man says. ""May I take a look at those ducks?"" the ranger says politely ""Sure, they're real beauties....help yourself"" replied the man. So the ranger puts on some gloves and takes out the first duck... he then proceeds to put his finger up the ducks butt. He looks at the man and says ""Hmmmm... this duck is from Montana"". The man is confused and thinks to himself that this ranger is weird. 


The ranger asks the man if he has a tag for hunting ducks in Montana on his license. ""No"" the man says nervously. So the ranger says ""I'm sorry but I'm gonna have too give you a $1000 citation"". Upset and confused the man doesn't say anything, he's shocked. So the ranger takes another duck out of the man's bag and again sticks his finger up the ducks butt. ""Hmmmm... this duck is from Florida, do you have a tag for that?"" the ranger says to the man. 

The man turns furiously red and replies ""NO!"" ""Well I guess I'm afraid that's another $1000 citation that I have to issue you."" the ranger replies. By this time the man is completely baffled and has never heard such bullcrap before. The ranger finally takes the last duck out of the bag and puts his finger up the ducks butt. ""Hmmm... this duck is from Colorado, I suppose you don't have a tag for that either?"" the ranger says to the man. 
""NOOOO"", shouts the man. ""Well I guess I'm gonna have to give you three citations today sir."" replies the ranger.

"You've all heard of the Air Force's ultra-high-security, super-secret base in Nevada, known simply as ""Area 51?""

Well, late one afternoon, the Air Force folks out at Area 51 were very surprised to see a Cessna landing at their ""secret"" base. They immediately impounded the aircraft and hauled the pilot into an interrogation room.

The pilot's story was that he took off from Vegas, got lost, and spotted the Base just as he was about to run out of fuel. The Air Force started a full FBI background check on the pilot and held him overnight during the investigation.

By the next day, they were finally convinced that the pilot really was lost and wasn't a spy. They gassed up his airplane, gave him a terrifying ""you-did-not-see-a-base"" briefing, complete with threats of spending the rest of his life in prison, told him Vegas was that-a-way on such-and-such a heading, and sent him on his way.

The day after that though, to the total disbelief of the Air Force, the same Cessna showed up again. Once again, the MP's surrounded the plane...only this time there were two people in the plane.

The same pilot jumped out and said, ""Do anything you want to me, but my wife is in the plane and you have to tell her where I was last night!""","Military",2598,4.5

She comes up on this trucker who is carrying a double-wide home and is taking up both lanes. To her disliking, he is only going about 45.

"In March 1992 a man living in Newton near Boston Massachusetts received a bill for his as yet unused credit card stating that he owed $0.00. He ignored it and threw it away. In April he received another and threw that one away too. The following month the credit card company sent him a very nasty note stating they were going to cancel his card if he didn't send them $0.00 by return of post. He called them, talked to them, they said it was a computer error and told him they'd take care of it. The following month he decided that it was about time that he tried out the troublesome credit card figuring that if there were purchases on his account it would put an end to his ridiculous predicament. However, in the first store that he produced his credit card in payment for his purchases he found that his card had been canceled. He called the credit card company who apologized for the computer error once again and said that they would take care of it. The next day he got a bill for $0.00 stating that payment was now overdue. Assuming that having spoken to the credit card company only the previous day the latest bill was yet another mistake he ignored it, trusting that the company would be as good as their word and sort the problem out. The next month he got a bill for $0.00 stating that he had 10 days to pay his account or the company would have to take steps to recover the debt. Finally giving in, he thought he would play the company at their own game and mailed them a check for $0.00. The computer duly processed his account and returned a statement to the effect that he now owed the credit card company nothing at all. A week later, the man's bank called him asking him what he was doing writing a check for $0.00. After a lengthy explanation the bank replied that the $0.00 check had caused their check processing software to fail. The bank could not now process ANY checks from ANY of their customers that day because the check for $0.00 was causing the computer to crash. The following month the man received a letter from the credit card company claiming that his check had bounced and that he now owed them $0.00 and unless he sent a check by return of post they would be taking steps to recover the debt. The man, who had been considering buying his wife a computer for her birthday, bought her a typewriter instead.","Computers",2656,1

"We all know how Cinderella wanted to go to the ball but her wicked
stepmother wouldn't let her and then the fairy godmother pops up
and gives Cinderella some good news:

The fairy godmother tells Cinderella that she will provide for her,
everything she needs to go to the ball, but only on two conditions.
Cinderella asks what she needs to do and the fairy godmother replies,
""First, you must wear a diaphragm.""  

Cinderella's mouth drops open and says, ""You must be crazy!  I'm on 
the pill, and I don't need to wear a diaphragm.""  

The fairy godmother reminds Cinderella about all the handsome princes 
that will be attending the ball that night, and Cinderella agrees to 
wear a diaphragm.

""Well, what's the second condition?""  Cinderella asked.

The fairy godmother replies, ""You must be back home by 2:00 A.M.
Well, Cinderella explains that if she's gonna go party with the
princes, she wants to be out all night long.  The fairy godmother
tells Cinderella that if she's not home by 2 A.M., then her diaphragm
will turn into a pumpkin. She goes on to say that at least she'll be
with the princes most of the evening, so Cinderella agrees to be home
at 2 A.M...

At 2 A.M., Cinderella doesn't show up...3 A.M., no Cinderella...4 A.M., no
Cinderella...finally, at 5 A.M., Cinderella shows up at the door with a
huge grin on her face. The fairy godmother stands up and looks at 
Cinderella and says, ""Where the hell have you been?  Your diaphragm 
was supposed to turn into a pumpkin 3 hours ago!!!""

Cinderella tells the fairy godmother that she met a prince and he took
care of it for her.  The fairy godmother wonders about a prince with this
type of power and asks Cinderella his name to which she replies,
""I can't remember, but it was Peter Peter something or other....""","Heaven and Hell",2749,5

""Well, what is it?"" he asks. ""It's a bit embarrassing,"" she replies, ""These 
two green circles have appeared on the inside of my thighs."" 

The doctor examines her and finally admits he has no idea what the cause is. 

Then he suddenly asks, ""Have you been having an affair with a gypsy lately?""

""We got her!"" replied the barkeeper.  ""She's upstairs in the second room

beers.  He grabbed the bottles, stomped up the stairs, kicked open the
second door on the right and yelled, ""I'm lookin' for the meanest, 
roughest and toughest whore in the Yukon!""

The woman inside the room looked at the miner and said, ""You found her!""

"It was George the Mailman's last day on the job after 35 years of carrying
the mail through all kinds of weather to the same neighborhood.  When he
arrived at the first house on his route he was greeted by the whole family
there, who roundly and soundly congratulated him and sent him on his way
with a tidy gift envelope.  At the second house they presented him with a 
box of fine cigars.  The folks at the third house handed him a selection of
terrific fishing lures.

   At the fourth house he was met at the door by a strikingly beautiful woman
in a revealing negligee.  She took him by the hand, gently led him through 
the door (which she closed behind him), and led him up the stairs to the 
bedroom where she blew his mind with the most passionate love he had 
ever experienced. When he had had enough they went downstairs, where she 
fixed him a giant breakfast: eggs, potatoes, ham, sausage, blueberry waffles, 
and fresh-squeezed orange juice.  When he was truly satisfied she poured him 
a cup of steaming coffee.  As she was pouring, he noticed a dollar bill
sticking out from under the cup's bottom edge.  ""All this was just too 
wonderful for words,"" he said, ""but what's the dollar for?""

  ""Well,"" she said, ""last night, I told my husband that today would be your
last day, and that we should do something special for you.  I asked him 
what to give you.  He said, 'SCREW him.  Give him a dollar.'  The breakfast
was my idea.""","Miscellaneous",2754,4
"A couple was planning on getting married.  Seeing how they didn't have much money to go on a honeymoon, they decided to just go back to their new apartment after the wedding.   

The groom had three close friends, that were prone to committing practical jokes.  One being a carpenter, the other a ordinary guy, and the third a dentist.

They all decided to pull practical jokes on their newly married friends.  The carpenter decided he would cut the slats in the bed so that when they climbed into bed, the bed would collapse.  The ordinary guy decided to short sheet the bed, so that when they got into it their feet wouldn't reach the bottom.  The dentist chuckled and wouldn't tell anyone what he planned to do.

A week later the 3 friends all received letters in the mail.  
""Dear friends, we didn't mind the fact that when we got into bed, the bed collapsed, or the guy that short sheeted it, but I'm gonna kill the bastard that put the novacaine in the vaseline!""","Money",2755,3

where the groom was 95 and the bride was 23.  The groom looked pretty

because his bride was a healthy, vivacious young woman.  But lo and
behold, the next morning, the bride came down the main staircase
slowly, step by step, hanging onto the bannister for dear life. 

She finally managed to get to the counter of the little shop in the
hotel. The clerk looked really concerned,  ""Whatever happened to you,
honey?  You look like you've been wrestling an alligator!"" 

The bride groaned, hung on to the counter and managed to speak,

"A truck driver, hauling a tractor-trailer load of computers, stops for a beer. As he approaches the bar, he sees a big sign on the door that says, ""COMPUTER NERDS NOT ALLOWED - ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK!"" He enters and sits down.

The bartender comes over to him, sniffs, and says that he smells kind of nerdy. He then asks him what he does for a living. The truck driver explains to him that he drives a truck, and the smell is just from the computers he is hauling. The bartender serves him a beer and says, ""OK, truck drivers aren't nerds.""

As he is sipping his beer, a skinny guy walks in wearing a pair of glasses with tape around the middle, a pocket protector with twelve kinds of pens and pencils, and a belt that is at least a foot too long. The bartender, without saying a word, pulls out a shotgun and blows the guy away. The truck driver asks him why he did that.

The bartender replied, ""Don't worry. The computer nerds are in season because they are overpopulating Silicon Valley. You don't even need a license.""

So the truck driver finishes his beer, gets back in his truck, and heads for the freeway. Suddenly, he veers to avoid an accident, and the load shifts. The back door breaks open and computers spill out all over the road. He jumps out and sees a crowd already forming, snatching up all of the computers. The scavengers are comprised of engineers, accountants and programmers - computer geeks. Each of them wearing the nerdiest clothes he has ever seen.

He can't let them steal his whole load. So remembering what happened in the bar, he pulls out his gun and starts blasting away, killing several of them instantly. A highway patrol officer comes zooming up and jumps out of the car screaming at him to stop.

The truck driver said, ""What's wrong? I thought computer nerds were in season.""

"Three turtles, Joe, Steve, and Poncho, decide to go on a picnic. Joe packs the picnic basket with cookies, bottled sodas, and sandwiches. The trouble is, the picnic site is 10 miles away, so the turtles take 10 whole days to get there.

By the time they do arrive, everyone's whipped and hungry. Joe takes the stuff out of the basket, one by one. He takes out the sodas and realizes that they forgot to bring a bottle opener. Joe & Steve beg Poncho to turn back home and retrieve it, but Poncho flatly refuses, knowing that they'll eat everything by the time he gets back.

Somehow, after about two hours, the turtles manage to convince Poncho to go, swearing on their great-grand turtles' graves that they won't touch the food. So, Poncho sets off down the road, slow and steady.

Twenty days pass, but no Poncho. Joe and Steve are hungry and puzzled, but a promise is a promise. Another day passes, and still no Poncho, but a promise is a promise. After three more days pass without Poncho in sight, Steve starts getting restless. ""I NEED FOOD!"" he says with a hint of dementia in his voice.

""NO!"" Joe retorts. ""We promised.""

Five more days pass. Joe realizes that Poncho probably skipped out to the Burger King down the road, so the two turtles weakly lift the lid, get a sandwich, and open their mouths to eat. But then, right at that instant, Poncho pops out behind a rock.

"Dr. Laura Schlessinger is a radio personality who dispenses advice to people who call in to her radio show.

Recently, she said that, as an observant Orthodox Jew, homosexuality is an abomination according to Leviticus 18:22 and cannot be condoned under any circumstance. The following is an open letter to Dr. Laura penned by a east coast resident, which was posted on the Internet.

Dear Dr. Laura:

Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law.

I have learned a great deal from your show, and try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate.

I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the other specific laws and how to follow them:

When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord - Lev.1:9. The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?

I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?

I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual unseemliness - Lev.15:19- 24. The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.

Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?

I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?

A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination - Lev. 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this?

Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?

Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev. 19:27. How should they die?

I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?

My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? - Lev.24:10-16. Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)

I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging.

Your devoted fan,

The tiger leapt toward me with a mighty ROARRR! I soiled
myself.""

Amused at the woman's thrift, the editor tells her that there is a 7 word minimum for all obituaries. Only a little flustered, she thinks things over and in a few seconds says, ""In that case, let it read: 'Fred Brown died: 1983 Pick-up for sale.'""","Old Age",2946,1.5
"At some point in time, a bad spell of wet weather came over a southern state, flooding most of many counties. Since the water was about six feet deep outside (and inside) their house, one family spent its time sitting on the porch roof, watching the wreckage float by.

The son happened to notice a nice straw hat as it went downstream. ""My,"" he thought, ""I'll bet the person who lost that hat is sorry now!""

After the hat had floated out of sight around the corner of the house, the boy kept watching the river. Suddenly, much to his surprise, here comes the hat, floating upstream, against the current!

This was obviously very strange, so the lad kept his eye on it. It floated upstream and around the other corner of the house... and came floating back down again. After a while, it came back upstream yet again, rounding the corner of the house.

Finally, the boy could stand it no longer and pointed out the hat to his mother, asking her whatever could cause such a sight. His mother replied, ""Oh, that's just your grandfather. He swore it'd take more than a few drops of rain to keep him from mowing the lawn today.""","Crazy Jokes",2947,3

""What?"" said the old man, being hard of hearing.

""I need a urine sample, a stool sample, and a sperm sample,"" repeated the doctor loudly.

"Calling in sick to work makes me uncomfortable because
no matter how legitimate my illness, because I always sense my boss thinks I am
lying.

On one occasion, I had a valid reason but lied anyway
because the truth was to humiliating to reveal. I simply mentioned that
I had sustained a head injury and I hoped I would feel up to coming in
the next day. By then, I could think up a doozy to explain the bandage
on my crown.

In this case, the truth hurt. I mean it really hurt in
the place men feel the most pain. The accident occurred mainly because
I conceded to my wife's wishes to adopt a cute little kitty

As the daily routine prescribes, I was taking my shower
after breakfast when I heard my wife, Deb, call out to me from the kitchen.
""Ed!"" she harkened. ""The garbage disposal is dead. Come reset it."" ""You
know where the button is."" I protested through the shower (pitter-patter).

""Reset it yourself!""

""I am scared!"" She pleaded. ""What if it starts going and
sucks me in?""

Pause. ""C'mon, it'll only take a second."" No logical assurance
about how a disposal can't start itself will calm the fears of a person
who suffers from ""Big-ol-scary-machine-phobia,"" a condition brought on
by watching too many Stephen King movies.

It is futile to argue or explain, kind of like telling
Lloyd Bentsen Americans are over-taxed. And if a poltergeist did, in fact,
possess the disposal, and she was ground into round, I'd have to live with
that the rest of my life.

So out I came, dripping wet and buck naked, hoping to
make a statement about how her cowardly behavior was, not without consequence,
but it was I who would suffer. I crouched down and stuck my head under
the sink to find the button.

It is the last action I remember performing. It struck
without warning, without respect to my circumstances. Nay, it wasn't a
hexed disposal, drawing me into its gnashing metal teeth. It was our new
kitty, clawing playfully at the dangling objects she spied between my legs.
She (""Buttons"" aka ""the Grater"") had been poised around the corner and
stalked me as I took the bait under the sink. At precisely the second I
was most vulnerable, she leapt at the toys I unwittingly offered and snagged
them with her needle-like claws.

Now when men feel pain or even sense danger anywhere close
to their masculine region, they lose all rational thought to control orderly
bodily movements. Instinctively, their nerves compel the body to contort
inwardly, while rising upwardly at a violent rate of speed. Not even a
well trained monk could calmly stand with his groin supporting the full
weight of a kitten and rectify the situation in a step-by-step procedure.
Wild animals are sometimes faced with a ""fight or flight"" syndrome; men,
in this predicament, choose only the ""flight"" option.

Fleeing straight up, I knew at that moment how a cat feels
when it is alarmed. It was a dismal irony. But, whereas cats seek great
heights to escape, I never made it that far. The sink and cabinet bluntly
impeded my ascent; the impact knocked me out cold.

When I awoke, my wife and the paramedics stood over me.
Having been fully briefed by my wife, the paramedics snorted as they tried
to conduct their work while suppressing their hysterical laughter. My wife
told me I should be flattered.

At the office, colleagues tried to coax an explanation
out of me. I kept silent, claiming it was too painful to talk. ""What's
the matter, cat got your tongue?""

If they had only known.","Animals",2951,5
"Cat fitness really can be fun. However, it is important to start any fitness program only when you feel like it. Don't let a few extra pounds intimidate you into becoming more active. The most important aspect of fitness is: when to start the program. The best time is at about 2 a.m. The house is quiet; there are no distractions. The warm-up is critical. Cats are experts at stretching, so this won't be a problem. Start with a few
wind sprints, full speed, toenails clicking on the tile or linoleum floors. A few low but loud growls will help you feel charged up.

Now it is time to add some eye-paw coordination work. Find a marble (the big steelies work even better) and roll that down the floor as the sprints continue. See how many times you can ricochet it off the wallboards before it disappears under the fridge. Finally, work on that upper body strength. Climbing is a great exercise. Use draperies, macram\u00e9 plant hangers, or clothing on hangers. You can even find some carpeting on some basement walls. Backs of chairs work well, too.

Now put it all together. A speed sprint to the end of the hall! A race around the living room! Leap to the back of the rocking chair! Let the rebound launch you to the top of the swinging planter! Rock that baby! Feel those muscles work. Just as the hook pulls loose from the ceiling, dash to the bedroom and dive under the covers.

"Some people say cats never have to be bathed. They say cats lick

The time comes, however, when a man must face reality; when he must
look squarely in the face of massive public sentiment to the contrary and
announce: ""This cat smells like a port-a-potty on a hot day in Juarez.""

When that day arrives at your house, as it has in mine, I have some
advice you might consider as you place your feline friend under you arm
and head for the bathtub:

* Know that although the cat has the advantage of quickness and lack
of concern for human life, you have the advantage of strength. Capitalize
on that advantage by selecting the battlefield. Don't try to bathe him
in an open area where he can force you to chase him. Pick a very small
bathroom. If your bathroom is more than four feet square, I recommend that
you get in the tub with the cat and close the sliding-glass doors as if
you were about to take a shower. (A simple shower curtain will not do.
A berserk cat can shred a three-ply rubber shower curtain quicker than
a politician can shift positions.)

* Know that a cat has claws and will not hesitate to remove all the
skin from your body. Your advantage here is that you are smart and know
how to dress to protect yourself. I recommend canvas overalls tucked into
high-top construction boots, a pair of steel-mesh gloves, an army helmet,
a hockey face mask and a long-sleeve flak jacket.

* Prepare everything in advance. There is no time to go out for a towel
when you have a cat digging a hole in your flak jacket. Draw the water.
Make sure the bottle of kitty shampoo is inside the glass enclosure. Make
sure the towel can be reached, even if you are lying on your back in the
water.

* Use the element of surprise. Pick up your cat nonchalantly, as if
to simply carry him to his supper dish. (Cats will not usually notice your
strange attire. They have little or no interest in fashion as a rule. If
he does notice your garb, calmly explain that you are taking part in a
product- testing experiment for J.C. Penney.)

* Once you are inside the bathroom, speed is essential to survival.
In a single liquid motion, shut the bathroom door, step into the tub enclosure,
slide the glass door shut, dip the cat in the water and squirt him with
shampoo. You have begun one of the wildest 45 seconds of your life. Cats
have no handles. Add the fact that he now has soapy fur, and the problem
is radically compounded. Do not expect to hold on to him for more that
two or three seconds at a time. When you have him, however, you must remember
to give him another squirt of shampoo and rub like crazy. He'll then spring
free and fall back into the water, thereby rinsing himself off. (The national
record is - for cats - three latherings, so don't expect too much.)

* Next, the cat must be dried. Novice cat bathers always assume this
part will be the most difficult, for humans generally are worn out at this
point and the cat is just getting really determined. In fact, the drying
is simple compared to what you have just been through. That's because by
now the cat is semi-permanently affixed to your right leg. You simply pop
the drain plug with your foot, reach for your towel and wait. (Occasionally,
however, the cat will end up clinging to the top of your army helmet. If
this happens, the best thing you can do is to shake him loose and to encourage
him toward your leg.) After all the water is drained from the tub, it is
a simple matter to just reach down and dry the cat.

In a few days the cat will relax enough to be removed from your leg.
He will usually have nothing to say for about three weeks and will spend
a lot of time sitting with his back to you. He might even become psychoceramic
and develop the fixed stare of a plaster figurine.

You will be tempted to assume he is angry. This isn't usually the case.
As a rule he is simply plotting ways to get through your defenses and injure
you for life the next time you decide to give him a bath. But, at least
now he smells a lot better","Animals",2960,1

For shadows to explore at night.

"How to tell if your cat has a problem by asking yourself the following
questions:","Animals",2970,4
"","Animals",2971,2
"** DOORS:

Do not allow closed doors in any room. To get door opened, stand on
hind legs and hammer with forepaws. Once door is opened, it is not necessary
to use it. After you have ordered an ""outside"" door opened, stand halfway
in and out and think about several things. This is particularly important
during very cold weather, rain, snow, or mosquito season. Swinging doors
are to be avoided at all costs.

** CHAIRS and RUGS:

If you have to throw up, get to a chair quickly. If you cannot manage
in time, get to an Oriental rug. If there is no Oriental rug, shag is good.
When throwing up on the carpet, make sure you back up so that it is as
long as the human's bare foot.

** BATHROOMS:

Always accompany guests to the bathroom. It is not necessary to do anything
-- just sit and stare.

** HAMPERING:

If one of your humans is engaged in some close activity and the other
is idle, stay with the busy one. This is called ""helping"", otherwise known
as ""hampering."" Following are the rules for ""hampering"":

a) When supervising cooking, sit just behind the left heel of the cook.
You cannot be seen and thereby stand a better chance of being stepped on
and then picked up and comforted.

b) For book readers, get in close under the chin, between eyes and book,
unless you can lie across the book itself.

c) For knitting projects or paperwork, lie on the work in the most appropriate
manner so as to obscure as much of the work or at least the most important
part. Pretend to doze, but every so often reach out and slap the pencil
or knitting needles. The worker may try to distract you; ignore it. Remember,
the aim is to hamper work.

Embroidery and needlepoint projects make great hammocks in spite of
what the humans may tell you.

d) For people paying bills (monthly activity) or working on income taxes
or Christmas cards (annual activity), keep in mind the aim -- to hamper!
First, sit on the paper being worked on. When dislodged, watch sadly from
the side of the table. When activity proceeds nicely, roll around on the
papers, scattering them to the best of your ability. After being removed
for the second time, push pens, pencils, and erasers off the table, one
at a time.

e) When a human is holding the newspaper in front of him/her, be sure
to jump on the back of the paper. They love to jump.

** WALKING:

As often as possible, dart quickly and as close as possible in front
of the human, especially: on stairs, when they have something in their
arms, in the dark, and when they first get up in the morning. This will
help their coordination skills.

** BEDTIME:

Always sleep on the human at night so s/he cannot move round.

** PLAY:

This is an important part of your life. Get enough sleep in the daytime
so you are fresh for your nocturnal games. Below are listed several favorite
cat games that you can play. It is important though to maintain one's Dignity
at all times. If you should have an accident during play, such as falling
off a chair, immediately wash a part of your body as if to say ""I MEANT
to do that!"" It fools those humans every time.

CAT GAMES:

""Catch Mouse"":

The humans would have you believe that those lumps under the covers
are their feet and hands. They are lying. They are actually Bed Mice, rumored
to be the most delicious of all the mice in the world, though no cat has
ever been able to catch one. Rumor also has it that only the most ferocious
attack can stun them long enough for you to dive under the covers to get
them. Maybe YOU can be the first to taste the Bed Mouse!

""King of the Hill"":

This game must be played with at least one other cat. The more, the
merrier! One or both of the sleeping humans is Hill 303 which must be defended
at all costs from the other cat(s). Anything goes. This game allows for
the development of unusual tactics as one must take the unstable playing
theater into account.

WARNING:

Playing either of these games to excess will result in expulsion from
the bed and possibly from the bedroom. Should the humans grow restless,
immediately begin purring and cuddle up to them.

This should buy you some time until they fall asleep again. If one happens
to be on a human when this occurs, this cat wins the round of King of the
Hill.

** TOYS:

Any small item is a potential toy. If a human tries to confiscate it,
this means that it is a Good Toy. Run with it under the bed. Look suitably
outraged when the human grabs you and takes it away.

Always watch where it is put so you can steal it later. Two reliable
sources of toys are dresser tops and wastebaskets. There are several types
of cat toys.

Bright shiny things like keys, brooches, or coins should be hidden so
that the other cat(s) or humans can't play with them. They are generally
good for playing hockey with on uncarpeted floors.

Dangly and/or string-like things such as shoelaces, cords, gold chains,
and dental floss also make excellent toys. They are favorites of humans
who like to drag them across the floor for us to pounce on. When a string
is dragged under a newspaper or throw rug, it magically becomes the Paper/Rug
Mouse and should be killed at all costs. Take care, though. Humans are
sneaky and will try to make you lose your Dignity.

** PAPER BAGS:

Within paper bags dwell the Bag Mice. They are small and camouflaged
to be the same color as the bag, so they are hard to see. But you can easily
hear the crinkling noises they make as they scurry around the bag. Anything,
up to and including shredding the bag, can be done to kill them. Note:
any other cat you may find in a bag hunting for Bag Mice is fair game for
a Sneak Attack, which will usually result in a great Tag match.

** FOOD:

In order to get the energy to sleep, play, and hamper, a cat must eat.
Eating, however, is only half the fun. The other half is getting the food.
Cats have two ways to obtain food: convincing a human you are starving
to death and must be fed *NOW*; and hunting for it oneself.

The following are guidelines for getting fed.

a) When the humans are eating, make sure you leave the tip of your tail
in their dishes when they are not looking.

b) Never eat food from your own bowl if you can steal some from the
table.

c) Never drink from your own water bowl if a human's glass is full enough
to drink from.

d) Should you catch something of your own outside, it is only polite
to attempt to get to know it. Be insistent -- your food will usually not
be so polite and try to leave.

e) Table scraps are delicacies with which the humans are unfortunately
unwilling to readily part. It is beneath the Dignity of a cat to beg outright
for food as lower forms of life such as dogs will, but several techniques
exist for ensuring that the humans don't forget you exist. These include,
but are not limited to: jumping onto the lap of the ""softest"" human and
purring loudly; lying down in the doorway between the dining room and the
kitchen, the Direct Stare, and twining around people's legs as they sit
and eat while meowing plaintively.

** SLEEPING:

As mentioned above, in order to have enough energy for playing, a cat
must get plenty of sleep. It is generally not difficult to find comfortable
place to curl up. Any place a human likes to sit is good, especially if
it contrasts with your fur color. If it's in a sunbeam or near a heating
duct or radiator, so much the better. Of course, good places also exist
outdoors, but have the disadvantages of being seasonal and dependent on
current and previous weather conditions such as rain. Open windows are
a good compromise.

** SCRATCHING POSTS:

It is advised that cats use any scratching post the humans may provide.
They are very protective of what they think is their property and will
object strongly if they catch you sharpening your claws on it. Being sneaky
and doing it when they aren't around won't help, as they are very observant.
If you are an outdoor kitty, trees are good. Sharpening your claws on a
human is a definite no-no!

** HUMANS:

Humans have three primary functions: to feed us, to play with and give
attention to us, and to clean the litter box. It is important to maintain
one's Dignity when around humans so that they will not forget who is the
master of the house. Humans need to know basic rules. They can be taught
if you start early and are consistent.

You will then have a smooth-running household.","Animals",2972,4

"Dear Sir,

I've been having some conflicts between programs lately. I've been running
the original version of DrinkingBuddies 1.0 as my primary application and
all the GirlFriend releases I've tried have always conflicted with it.
I hear that DrinkingBuddies won't crash if GirlFriend is run in background
mode and the sound is turned off. But I'm embarrassed to say I can't find
the switch to turn the sound off. I just run them separately and it works
okay. GirlFriend also seems to have a problem co-existing with my Golf
program, often trying to abort Golf with some sort of timing incompatibility.

I probably should have stayed with GirlFriend 1.0, but I thought I might
see better performance from GirlFriend 2.0. After months of conflicts and
other problems, I consulted a friend who has had experience with GirlFriend
2.0. He said I probably didn't have enough cache to run GirlFriend 2.0,
and eventually it would require a Token Ring to run properly. He was right
- as soon as I purged my cache, it uninstalled itself. Shortly after that,
I installed GirlFriend 3.0 beta. All the bugs were supposed to be gone
but the first time I used it, it gave me a virus. I had to clean out my
whole system and shut down for a while. I very cautiously upgraded to GirlFriend
4.0. This time I used a SCSI probe first and also installed a virus protection
program. It worked okay for a while until I discovered that GirlFriend
1.0 was still in my system. I tried running GirlFriend 1.0 again with GirlFriend
4.0 still installed, but GirlFriend 4.0 has a feature I didn't know about
that automatically senses the presence of any other version of GirlFriend
and communicates with it in some way, which results in the immediate removal
of both versions. The version I have now works pretty well, but there are
still some problems.

Like all versions of GirlFriend, it is written in some obscure language
I can't understand, much less reprogram. Frankly, I think there is too
much attention paid to the look and feel rather than the desired functionality.
Also, to get the best connections with your hardware, you usually have
to use gold-plated contacts. And I've never liked how GirlFriend is totally
object-oriented.

A year ago, a friend of mine upgraded his version of GirlFriend to GirlFriendPlus
1.0, which is a Terminate and Stay Resident version of GirlFriend. He discovered
that GirlFriendPlus 1.0 expires within a year if you don't upgrade to Fianc\u00e9
1.0. So he did, but soon after that, he had to upgrade to Wife 1.0, which
he describes as a huge resource hog. It has taken up all his space so he
can't load anything else. One of the primary reasons he decided to go with
Wife 1.0 was because it came bundled with FreeSexPlus. Well, it turns out
that the resource allocation module of Wife 1.0 sometimes prohibits access
to FreeSexPlus, particularly the new Plug-Ins he wanted to try. On top
of that, Wife 1.0 must be running on a well warmed-up system before he
can do anything.

Although he did not ask for it, Wife 1.0 also came with MotherInLaw
1.0 which has an automatic pop-up feature he can't turn off. I told him
to try installing Mistress 1.0, but he said he'd heard that if you try
to run it without first uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife 1.0 will delete MSMoney
files before doing the uninstall itself. Then, Mistress 1.0 won't install
anyway because of insufficient resources.","Computers",3031,5

"Costello calls Abbott with some questions about UNIX

Costello: What is the command that will tell me the revision code of
a program?

Abbott: Yes, that's correct.

Costello: No, what is it?

Abbott: Yes.

Costello: So, which is the one?

Abbott: No. 'which' is used to find the program.

Costello: Stop this. Who are you?

Abbott: Use 'who am i' not 'who r yoo'. You can also 'finger yoo' to
get information about yoo'.

Costello: All I want to know is what finds the revision code?

Abbott: Use 'what'.

Costello: That's what I am trying to find out. Isn't that true?

Abbott: No. 'true' gives you 0.

Costello: Which one?

Abbott: 'true' gives you 0. 'which is program name'

Costello: Let's get back to my problem. What program? How do I find
it?

Abbott: Type 'find / -name it -print' to find 'it'. Type 'what program'
to get the revision code.

Costello: I want to find the revision code.

Abbott: You can't 'find revisioncode', you must use 'what program'.

Costello: Which command will do what I need?

Abbott: No. 'which command' will find 'command'.

Costello: I think I understand. Let me write that.

Abbott: You can 'write that' only if 'that' is a user on your system.

Costello: Write what?

Abbott: No. 'write that'. 'what program'.

Costello: Cut that out!

Abbott: Yes. those are valid files for 'cut'. Don't forget the options.

Costello: Do you always do this?

Abbott: 'du' will give you disk usage.

Costello: HELP!

Abbott: 'help' is only used for Source Code Control System (SCCS).

Costello: You make me angry.

Abbott: No, I don't 'make me' angry but I did 'make programname' when
I was upset once.

Costello: I don't want to make trouble, so no more.

Abbott: No 'more'? 'which' will help you find 'more'. Every system has
'more'.

Costello: Nice help! I'm confused more now!

Abbott: Understand that since 'help' is such a small program, it is
better not to 'nice help' and 'more now' is not allowed, but 'at now' is.
Unless of course 'now' is a file name.

Costello: This is almost as confusing as my PC.

Abbott: I didn't know you needed help with 'pc'. Let me get you to the

"Once upon a midnight dreary, fingers cramped and vision bleary,
System manuals piled high and wasted paper on the floor,
Longing for the warmth of bed sheets, still I sat there doing spreadsheets.
Having reached the bottom line I took a floppy from the drawer,
I then invoked the SAVE command and waited for the disk to store,
Only this and nothing more.

Deep into the monitor peering, long I sat there wond'ring, fearing,
Doubting, while the disk kept churning, turning yet to churn some more.
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token.
""Save!"" I said, ""You cursed machine!  Save my data from before!""
One thing did the phosphors answer, only this and nothing more,
Just, ""Abort, Retry, Ignore?""

Was this some occult illusion, some maniacal intrusion?
These were choices undesired, ones I'd never faced before.
Carefully I weighed the choices as the disk made impish noises.
The cursor flashed, insistent, waiting, baiting me to type some more.
Clearly I must press a key, choosing one and nothing more,
From ""Abort, Retry, Ignore?""

With fingers pale and trembling, slowly toward the keyboard bending,
Longing for a happy ending, hoping all would be restored,
Praying for some guarantee, timidly, I pressed a key.
But on the screen there still persisted words appearing as before.
Ghastly grim they blinked and taunted, haunted, as my patience wore,
Saying ""Abort, Retry, Ignore?""

I tried to catch the chips off guard, and pressed again, but twice as hard.
I pleaded with the cursed machine: I begged and cried and then I swore.
Now in mighty desperation, trying random combinations,
Still there came the incantation, just as senseless as before.
Cursor blinking, angrily winking, blinking nonsense as before.
Reading, ""Abort, Retry, Ignore?""

There I sat, distraught, exhausted, by my own machine accosted.
Getting up I turned away and paced across the office floor.
And then I saw a dreadful sight: a lightning bolt cut through the night.
A gasp of horror overtook me, shook me to my very core.
The lightning zapped my previous data, lost and gone forevermore.
Not even, ""Abort, Retry, Ignore?""

To this day I do not know, the place to which lost data go.
What demonic nether world us wrought where lost data will be stored,
Beyond the reach of mortal souls, beyond the ether, into black holes?
But sure as there's C, Pascal, Lotus, Ashton-Tate and more,
You will one day be left to wander, lost on some Plutonian shore,
Pleading, ""Abort, Retry, Ignore?""","Computers",3035,2

"In the beginning, there was chaos and the Universe was without form
and void. The Lord looked upon His domain and decided to declare His presence.
""I be"" he said, then to correct his grammar added ""am."" If the Lord had
decided to work on irregular verb conjugation first, this wouldn't have
happened. God would later curse the English language for its part, but
in that moment IBM came into being. The Lord looked out upon the IBM He
had created and said ""This is good."" That's what He said, but He shook
his head, wondered what the boys at the User Group would say, split the
light from the dark and went to bed. Thus passed the Beginning and the
end of the first day.

On the second day, the Lord summoned IBM unto His presence. ""There is
chaos out there, and the Universe is without form and void. I must correct
this and I can use your help. Is there anything you can do for me?""

""I can take care of form,"" IBM replied. ""Put me in charge of computers
and I will take care of form for you.""

The Lord thought that this was good and said ""Let there be computers.
Let IBM have my powers of creation that pertain to computers and form.""
Thus saying, the Lord went off to His second day's work while IBM created
the 1401.

On the third day, while the Lord was out, IBM decided to subdivide the
assgined task. ""Let there be systems that make the computer work and let
them be called Operating Systems. Let there also be systems that make use
of the computer and let them be called Application Systems."" Thus, there
came into being both Operating Systems and Application Systems, but there
were no programmers.

The next morning IBM had to give the Lord a status report.

""What did you do yesterday?"" the Lord asked.

""I invented the operating system"" IBM replied.

""You did?"" the Lord shuddered. ""Oh dear.""

""Yes I did,"" IBM confirmed, ""but I find I need something you alone can
provide.""

""And what is that?""

""I need programmers to use my computers, to operate my operating system
and to apply my applications.""

""That can't be done now,"" said the Lord. ""This is only the fourth day
and there won't be people until the sixth day.""

""I need programmers and I need them now. If they can't be people they
can't be people, but we have to work this out today.""

""Give me some specifications and I'll see what I can do."" IBM hastily
worked up specs for programmers (are specs ever anything other than hasty)
and the Lord reviewed them. The Lord knew the specs weren't sufficient
but followed them anyway. He also made some programmers that did just what
programmers were supposed to do, just to spite IBM. The programmers and
IBM spent the rest of the day creating the Assembler and FORTRAN. On the
morning of the fifth day, IBM reported to the Lord once again.

""The programmers you created for me have a problem. They want a programming
language that is easy to use and similar to English. I told them you had
cursed English, though I still don't know why. They wanted me to ask your
indulgence on this.""

The Lord had cursed English for good reason, but didn't want to explain
this to IBM. He said ""let there be COBOL"" and that was that.

On the status report of the next day IBM announced that computers had
gone forth and multiplied. Unfortunately, the computers still weren't big
enough or fast enough to do what the programmers wanted. The Lord liked
the idea of going forth multiplying, and used the line Himself later on
that day. This sixth day being particularly busy, He declared ""Let there
be MVS"" and there was MVS.

On the seventh day God had finished creation and computers had COBOL
and MVS. The Lord and IBM took the day off to go fishing. IBM hung a sign
on the door to help programmers in his absence.


On the start of the second week the programmers went over IBM's cathode
ray tube directly to God. ""We have a horrible problem,"" they complained.
""Our users want systems that perform according to their expectations.""

""USERS!"" the Lord bellowed. ""Who said that you should have users! Users
are the difference between good and bad applications, a function I have
reserved unto myself! Who authorized you to have users?""

""Well, IBM...""

""IBM!! You!! You did this to my programmers! You gave them the knowledge
of good and evil. For that you shall suffer through eternity! Let there
be competition. Let it be called Anacom, and Burroughs, and CDC."" The Lord
went through the alphabet several times. ""With all this competition you
shall still suffer the pain of antitrust legislation all the days of your
existence.""

to conclude our report. In case you missed something, a summary of key

"Like every other techie, I couldn't wait to get my hands on the just released, state-of-the-art, 64-bit, 128 mega-RAM, 48x, 24/7, in your face, out of your control Microself Windows 2001. Yes, that was me at the front of the line in our local Get-a-Life Software store, waiting, waiting, for the moment when the future went on sale. And now that the future is installed in my computer, there's no looking back.

To be truthful, I don't use computers. They use me. They use me as a portal between the glittering new world of information and the mundane world where ordinary people have to eat and talk and sometimes be sad. Computers use my nimble fingers to unlock their codes, releasing raw information into the ether. Taking my mission as seriously as I do, I wanted the most up-to-the-second tool on the market. And that's why, the day after I installed Windows 2001, I was back at Get-a-Life buying the upgrade, Windows 2001, version 2.0.

With Windows 2001 2.0, I don't process information. I download it into my body. Using Windows' revolutionary US-ME serial port installed in my navel, I plug myself into my computer. Like the umbilical cord that fed me when I was mere flesh, the US-ME cable feeds raw data straight into my bloodstream. There it flows until it reaches the central processing unit I used to call my brain. And there, Windows' revolutionary Brain Bot - a tiny microchip embedded in my cerebrum -- turns that raw data into wisdom that makes me smarter, richer, and so much wiser than the rest of you.

Did you know that the capital of Uganda is Kampala? That Soupy Sales had a lion puppet named Pookie? That the square root of 3 is 1.732? And that today's kids will spend 23 years of their lives on the Internet swimming through vital data like this? O, it's a changing world, my friend. When you leave your Silicon Valley job for two weeks of R & R, take a cruise to Antarctica, step onto an ice floe and see penguins crowded around a laptop checking out The Weather Channel, get worried!

But I'm not worried, I'm wired. Wired to the upgraded upgrade I bought last weekend. Windows 2001 3.0 is the one with HandPrint, the printer driver that drives my digital age. Using HandPrint, I don't need an ordinary printer. I just click a button on my wrist and my hand begins scrolling across a blank page printing my raw data in any of 1,257 perfect fonts. The moving hand writes, and having writ, gives way to ear-mail.

I know, I know. You all have e-mail accounts. You can e-mail Bill Gates if you want. The Pope. Your dog if you're on vacation in Antarctica. But only Windows 2001 4.0, which I bought yesterday, has ear-mail.

When I hear a voice from the ether saying ""You've got mail!"" I run to the nearest phone. Then I run my ear-mail cord from the phone to an input implanted below my left ear. Within seconds, I'm hearing the mail read by a soothing voice that sounds a little like James Earl Jones on Prozac. To reply, I simply speak my answer, press the same button on my wrist, and presto. I unplug and go back to my daily duty of becoming richer,
smarter, and wiser. There's also a wireless version of e-mail but that won't come out until version 5.0 is released tomorrow. I plan to get in line at Get-a-Life sometime before midnight.

But where, you ask, is this wireless world headed? To be truthful, I'm not sure, but it sure is fun. Perhaps when I'm even richer, smarter, and wiser than I am now, thanks to
Windows 2001 6.0 due out this weekend, I'll have an answer. Until then, you'll have to excuse me. I have mail.","Computers",3083,5

"An old, bearded shepherd, with a crooked staff, walks up to a stone pulpit and says:

""And lo it came to pass that the trader by the name of Abraham Com did take unto himself a young wife by the name of Dot. And Dot Com was a comely woman, broad of shoulder and long of leg. Indeed, she had been called Amazon Dot Com. And she said unto Abraham, her husband, ""Why doth thou travel far, from town to town, with thy goods when thou can trade without ever leaving thy tent?""

And Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of a camel load, but simply said, ""How, Dear?"" And Dot replied, ""I will place drums in all the towns and drums in between to send messages saying what you have for sale and they will reply telling you which hath the best price. And the sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by Uriah's Pony Stable (UPS)"".

Abraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way with the drums. And the drums rang out and were an immediate success. Abraham sold all the goods he had, at the top price, without ever moving from his tent. But this success did arouse envy. A man named Maccabia did secrete himself inside Abraham's drum and was accused of insider trading. And the young man did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy horsefly take to camel dung.

They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Siderites, or NERDS for short. And lo the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums, that no one noticed that the real riches were going to the drum maker, one Brother William of Gates, who bought up every drum company in the land. And indeed did insist on making drums that would only work if you bought Brother Gates' drumsticks.

And Dot did say, ""Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by others"". And as Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or as it came to be known, ""eBay,"" he said, ""we need a name of a service that reflects what we are,"" and Dot replied, ""Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators.""

And gig was your middle finger upright
Now they all mean different things

A program was a tv show
A cursor used profanity
A keyboard was a piano

Memory was something that you lost with age
A cd was a bank account

Not something you did to a file

You'd be in jail for a while

A mouse pad was where a mouse lived
And a backup happened to your commode

Cut you did with a pocket knife
Paste you did with glue

And the memory in my head

"New York -- People for Ethical Treatment of Software (PETS) announced today that seven more software companies have been added to the group's ""watch list"" of companies that regularly practice software testing.

""There is no need for software to be mistreated in this way so that companies like these can market new products,"" said Ken Grandola, spokesperson for PETS. ""Alternative methods of testing these products are available.""

According to PETS, these companies force software to undergo lengthy and arduous tests, often without rest, for hours or days at a time. Employees are assigned to ""break"" the software by any means necessary, and inside sources report that they often joke
about ""torturing"" the software.

""It's no joke,"" said Grandola. ""Innocent programs, from the day they are compiled, are cooped up in tiny rooms and ""crashed"" for hours on end. They spend their whole lives on dirty, ill-maintained computers, and are unceremoniously deleted when they're not needed anymore.""

Grandola said the software is kept in unsanitary conditions and is infested with bugs.

""We know that alternatives to this horror exist,"" he said, citing industry giant Microsoft Corporation as a company that has become successful without resorting to software testing.","Computers",3111,2

"Come and listen to a story 'bout a man named Jed,
A poor college kid, barely kept his family fed,
But one day he was talking to a recruiter,
Who said, ""they pay big bucks if ya work on a computer...""

UNIX, that is... CRTs... Workstations...

Well, the first thing ya know ol' Jed's an Engineer.
The kinfolk said ""Jed, move away from here"".
They said ""Arizona is the place ya oughta be"",
So he bought a box of donuts and he moved to Ahwatukee...

Intel, that is... dry heat... no amusement parks...

On his first day at work, they stuck him in a cube.
Fed him mo' donuts and sat him at a tube.
Said ""yo project's outta budget, but we know just what to do.
Instead of 40 hours, we'll work you 52!""

OT, that is... unpaid... mandatory...

The weeks rolled by and things were looking bad.
Schedules were slipping and the boss was getting mad.
They called another meeting and decided on a fix.
The answer was simple... ""We'll work him sixty-six!""

Tired, that is... stressed out... no social life...

Months turned to years and his hair was turning grey.
Jed worked hard while his life just slipped away.
Waiting to retire when he turned to 64,
Instead he got a call and escorted out the door.

Laid off, that is... lead hand shake... unemployed...

Now the moral of the story is listen to what you're told,
Companies will use you and discard you when you're old.

This is straight from DC:

If you receive an email entitled ""Badtimes"", delete it IMMEDIATELY.

Do not open it. Apparently this one is pretty nasty. It will not only erase everything on your hard drive, but it will also delete anything on disks within 20 feet of your computer. It demagnetizes the strips on ALL of your credit cards.

It reprograms your ATM access code, screws up the tracking on your VCR and uses subspace field harmonics to scratch any CD's you attempt to play.It will program your phone auto-dial to call only 900 numbers. This virus will mix antifreeze into your fish tank.

IT WILL CAUSE YOUR TOILET TO FLUSH WHILE YOU ARE SHOWERING.

It will drink ALL your beer. FOR GOD'S SAKE, ARE YOU LISTENING??

It will leave dirty underwear on the coffee table when you are expecting company. It will replace your shampoo with Nair and you Nair with Rogaine, all the while dating your current boy/girlfriend behind your back and billing their hotel rendezvous to your Visa card. It will cause you to run with scissors and throw things in a way that is only fun until someone loses an eye.

It will rewrite your backup files, changing all your active verbs to passive tense and incorporating undetectable misspellings which grossly change the interpretations of key sentences.

If the ""Badtimes"" message opened in a Windows 95/98 environment, it will leave the toilet seat up and leave your hair dryer plugged in dangerously close to a full bathtub.

Lugging groceries through the kitchen door.
Awaiting her arrival was her 8 year old son,
Anxious to relate what his younger brother had done.

""While I was out playing and Dad was on a call,
T.J. took his crayons and wrote on the wall!
It's on the new paper you just hung in the den.
I told him you'd be mad at having to do it again.""

She let out a moan and furrowed her brow,
""Where is your little brother right now?""
She emptied her arms and with a purposeful stride,
She marched to his closet where he had gone to hide.

She called his full name as she entered his room.
He trembled with fear--he knew that meant doom!
For the next ten minutes, she ranted and raved
About the expensive wallpaper and how she had saved.

Lamenting all the work it would take to repair,
She condemned his actions and total lack of care.
The more she scolded, the madder she got,
Then stomped from his room, totally distraught!

She headed for the den to confirm her fears.
When she saw the wall, her eyes flooded with tears.
The message she read pierced her soul with a dart.
It said, ""I love Mommy,"" surrounded by a heart.

Well, the wallpaper remained, just as she found it,
With an empty picture frame hung to surround it.

She descended the stairs, & saw the old man.
He was covered with ashes & soot, which fell with a
shrug, ""Oh great,"" muttered the mom, ""Now I have to clean the rug.""

You'll relax, take it easy, watch The Young & The Restless.""

""Mommy?! Come quickly, I'm scared & I'm wet.""
The clone replied, ""I'm coming, sweetheart.""

as she bundled the child in a blanket cocoon.
""You're the best mommy ever.  I really love you.""

The mom frowned & said, ""Sorry, Santa, no deal.""

A man went into a pharmacy and asked to talk to a male pharmacist. The woman he
was talking to said that she was the pharmacist and that she and her sister
owned the store, so there were no males employed there. She then asked if there
was something which she could help the gentleman with.

The man said that it was something that he would be much more comfortable discussing with a male pharmacist.

The female pharmacist assured him that she was completely professional and
whatever it was that he needed to discuss, he could be confident that she would
treat him with the highest level of professionalism.

The man agreed and began by saying, ""This is tough for me to discuss, but I have
a permanent erection. It causes me a lot of problems and severe embarrassment. So I was wondering what you could give me for it?""

The pharmacist said, ""Just a minute, I'll go talk to my sister.""

"Many women are afraid of their first mammogram,
but there is no need to worry. By taking a few minutes
each day for a week preceding the exam and doing
the following practice exercises, you will be totally
prepared for the test, and best of all, you can do
these simple practice exercises right in your home.

Exercise 1:
Open your refrigerator door and insert one breast
between the door and the main box. Have one of
your strongest friends slam the door shut as hard
as possible and lean on the door for good measure.
Hold that position for five seconds. Repeat again
in case the first time wasn't effective enough.

Exercise 2:
Visit your garage at 3 AM when the temperature of
the cement floor is just perfect. Take off all your
clothes and lie comfortably on the floor with one
breast wedged under the rear tire of the car. Ask
a friend to slowly back the car up until your breast
is sufficiently flattened and chilled. Turn over and
repeat for the other breast.

Exercise 3:
Freeze two metal bookends overnight. Strip to the
waist. Invite a stranger into the room. Press the
bookends against one of your breasts. Smash the
bookends together as hard as you can. Set an
appointment with the stranger to meet next year
and do it again. You are now properly prepared.","Medical",3220,2

"Most diets fail because we are still thinking and eating like people. For those us who have never had any success dieting, well, now there is the new Miracle Cat Diet!
 
Except for cats that eat like people -- such as getting lots of table scraps -- most cats are long and lean (or tiny and petite). The Cat Miracle Diet will help you achieve the same lean, svelte figure. Just follow this diet for one week and you'll find that you not only look and feel better, but you will have a whole new outlook on what constitutes food.  Good Luck!
 
DAY ONE
 
Breakfast:  Open can of expensive gourmet cat food. Any flavor as long as it cost more the .75 per can -- and place 1/4 cup on your plate. Eat 1 bite of food; look around room disdainfully. Knock the rest on the floor. Stare at the wall for awhile before stalking off into the other room.
Lunch:  Four blades of grass and one lizard tail. Throw it back up on the cleanest carpet in your house.
Dinner:  Catch a moth and play with it until it is almost dead. Eat one wing. Leave the rest to die.
Bedtime snack:  Steal one green bean from your spouse's or partner's plate. Bat it around the floor until it goes under the refrigerator. Steal one small piece of chicken and eat half of it. Leave the other half on the sofa. Throw out the remaining gourmet cat food from the can you opened this morning.
 
DAY TWO
 
Breakfast:  Picking up the remaining chicken bite from the sofa. Knock it onto the carpet and bat it under the television set. Chew on the corner of the newspaper as your spouse/partner tries to read it.
Lunch:  Break into the fresh French bread that you bought as your part of the dinner party on Saturday. Lick the top of it all over. Take one bite out of the middle of the loaf.
Afternoon snack:  Catch a large beetle and bring it into the house. Play toss and catch with it until it is mushy and half dead. Allow it to escape under the bed.
Dinner:  Open a fresh can of dark-colored gourmet cat food -- tuna or beef works well. Eat it voraciously. Walk from your kitchen to the edge of the living room rug. Promptly throw up on the rug. Step into it as you leave. Track footprints across the entire room.
 
DAY THREE
 
Breakfast:  Drink part of the milk from your spouse's or partner's cereal bowl when no one is looking. Splatter part of it on the closest polished aluminum appliance you can find.
Lunch:  Catch a small bird and bring it into the house. Play with on top of your down filled comforter. Make sure the bird is seriously injured but not dead before you abandon it for someone else to have to deal with.
Dinner:  Beg and cry until you are given some ice cream or milk in a bowl of your own.  Take three licks/laps and then turn the bowl over on the floor.

"Dear Mom,

Our scout master told us all write to our parents in case you saw the
flood on TV and worried.  We are OK.  Only 1 of our tents and 2
sleeping bags got washed away.  Luckily, none of us got drowned
because we were all up on the mountain looking for Chad when it
happened. Oh yes, please call Chad's mother and tell her he is OK.
He can't write because of the cast.  I got to ride in one of the
search & rescue jeeps. It was neat.  We never would have found him in
the dark if it hadn't been for the lightning.

Scoutmaster Webb got mad at Chad for going on a hike alone without
telling anyone.  Chad said he did tell him, but it was during the
fire so he probably didn't hear him.  Did you know that if you put
gas on a fire, the gas can will blow up?  The wet wood still didn't
burn, but one of our tents did.  Also some of our clothes. John is
going to look weird until his hair grows back.

We will be home on Saturday if Scoutmaster Webb gets the car fixed.
It wasn't his fault about the wreck.  The brakes worked OK when we
left. Scoutmaster Webb said that a car that old you have to expect
something to break down; that's probably why he can't get insurance
on it.  We think it's a neat car.  He doesn't care if we get it
dirty, and if it's hot, sometimes he lets us ride on the tailgate.
It gets pretty hot with 10 people in a car.  He let us take turns
riding in the trailer until the highway patrolman stopped and talked
to us.

Scoutmaster Webb is a neat guy.  Don't worry, he is a good driver.
In fact, he is teaching Terry how to drive.  But he only lets him
drive on the mountain roads where there isn't any traffic.  All we
ever see up there are logging trucks.

This morning all of the guys were diving off the rocks and swimming
out in the lake.  Scoutmaster Webb wouldn't let me because I can't
swim and Chad was afraid he would sink because of his cast, so he let
us take the canoe across the lake.  It was great.  You can still see
some of the trees under the water from the flood.  Scoutmaster Webb
isn't crabby like some scoutmasters.  He didn't even get mad about
the life jackets.

He has to spend a lot of time working on the car so we are trying not
to cause him any trouble.  Guess what?  We have all passed our first
aid merit badges.  When Dave dove in the lake and cut his arm, we got
to see how a tourniquet works.  Also Wade and I threw up.
Scoutmaster Webb said it probably was just food poisoning from the
leftover chicken, he said they got sick that way with the food they
ate in prison.  I'm so glad he got out and become our scoutmaster.
He said he sure figured out how to get things done better while he
was doing his time.

I have to go now.  We are going into town to mail our letters and buy
bullets.  Don't worry about anything. We are fine.

A loss to Mats and his country of Sweden
Next up, it's easy - but just a 3-2 win
By a bunch of young fellas from united Berlin
They can't hit the net, they can't even pass it
There not chance in the world they're gonna beat Hasek
It's the bloody big ice, it's a number of things
They don't want it as much, they got their cup rings
But a 33 tie, with a late goal you would like
Scored by none other than Joe Nieuwendyk
The one that they thought was too slow and too old
Has not given up the quest for hockey gold.
Then things started changing, all for the best
They beat Selanne and Finland, lets take on the rest.
Then Sweden was next, they'd better get loose
But the Swedes were beaten by who... Belarus!
And then the ladies from out of the blue
Against the favoured Americans, knew what to do
The Yanks threw our flag on the floor they were told
So they captured our hearts and captured the gold
Then suddenly the Great one, our hero of youth
Told the hockey world the absolute truth
He said they don't like us, they want us to lose
We need to get meaner and inflict the odd bruise
So a North American Final was set us and the States
This time they were ready, they laced up their skates
This game was about skill, speed, and the odd chance
It would not be decided by a dumb judge from France
The yanks scored first, we sucked in our chest
But our boys came out and they played their best
Sakic, Lindros, Iginla, Lemeiux
And Gold is ours... Canada, 5 Yanks, 2
Despite the bad press and media opinions
We danced in the street like crazed Palestinians
From Victoria to St. John's we screamed and we shouted
Like Don Cherry predicted, the Yanks... they were routed
When we play hockey there is no English or French
There is no division among us; it's just the guys on the bench
They played the game for our Country, they played it true
And on behalf of the Country I say thank you.
For this game is now ours, there is no longer a debate
About the lack of finesse or the way that we skate

Next comes the American competitor in a sparkling stars and stripes costume, skating to some rock and roll music. He gets the crowd clapping, but is not technically as good as the Russian. He slightly misses landing a triple spin and loses the center during a spin. But, artistically, it is a more satisfying performance.

He tries to get up, staggers a few paces then slips again. He spends his entire 'routine' getting up then falling over again. Finally he crawls off the ice a tattered and bleeding mess.

I've spoken to the cabin services director, and club is also full. However, we do have one seat in first class.""

Before the lady has a chance to answer, the stewardess continues...

""It is most extraordinary to make this kind of upgrade, however, and I have had to get special permission from the captain. But, given the circumstances, the captain felt that it was outrageous that someone should be forced to sit next such an obnoxious person.""

Having said that, the stewardess turned to the black man sitting next to the lady, and said: ""So if you'd like to get your things, sir, I have your seat ready for you...""","Miscellaneous",3267,3

"Twas the night before Christmas
when all through the house
I searched for the tools
o hand to my spouse
Instructions were studied
and we were inspired,
in hopes we could manage
""Some Assembly Required.""
The children were quiet (not asleep) in their beds,
while Dad and I faced the evening with dread:
a kitchen, two bikes, Barbie's town house to boot!
And, thanks to Grandpa, a train with a toot!
We opened the boxes,
my heart skipped a beat- let no parts be missing
or parts incomplete!
Too late for last-minute returns or replacement;
if we can't get it right, it goes in the basement!
When what to my worrying eyes should appear
but 50 sheets of directions, concise, but not clear,
With each part numbered and every slot named,
so if we failed, only we could be blamed.
More rapid than eagles the parts then fell out,
all over the carpet they were scattered about.
""Now bolt it! Now twist it! Attach it right there!
Slide on the seats, and staple the stair!
Hammer the shelves, and nail to the stand.""
""Honey,"" said hubby, ""you just glued my hand.""
And then in a twinkling, I knew for a fact
that all the toy dealers had indeed made a pact
to keep parents busy all Christmas Eve night
with ""assembly required"" till morning's first light
We spoke not a word, but kept bent at our work,
till our eyes, they went bleary; our fingers all hurt.
The coffee went cold and the night, it wore thin
before we attached the last rod and last pin.
Then laying the tools away in the chest,
we fell into bed for a well-deserved rest.
But I said to my husband just before I passed out,
""This will be the best Christmas, without any doubt.
Tomorrow we'll cheer, let the holiday ring,
and not have to run to the store for a thing!
We did it! We did it! The toys are all set
for the perfect, most perfect, Christmas, I bet!""
Then off to dreamland and sweet repose
I gratefull went, though I suppose
there's something to say for those self-deluded-
I'd forgotten that BATTERIES are never included!","Holidays",3282,5

"Dear Santa,

I understand that one of my colleagues has petitioned you for changes in her contract, specifically asking for anatomical and  career changes.

In addition, it is my understanding that disparaging remarks were made about me, my ability to please, and some of  my fashion choices.  I would like to take this opportunity to inform you of  some issues concerning Ms. Barbie, and some of my own needs and  desires.

First of all, I, along with several other colleagues feel Barbie DOES NOT deserve preferential treatment - the bitch has everything.

I, along with Joe, Jem, Raggedy Ann & Andy, DO NOT have a dreamhouse, Corvette, evening gowns, and in some cases the ability to change our hair style.  I personally have only 3 outfits  which I am forced to mix and match at great length. 

My decision to accessorize my outfits with an earring was my decision and reflects my lifestyle choice.

I too would like a change in my career.  Have you ever considered ""Decorator Ken"", ""Beauty Salon Ken"", or ""Out Of Work Actor Ken""?  In addition, there are several other avenues which could be considered such as:  ""S&M Ken"" , ""Green Lantern Ken"",  ""Circuit  Ken"", ""Bear Ken"", ""Master Ken"".

These would more accurately reflect my desires and perhaps open up new markets.

And as for Barbie  needing bendable arms so she can ""push me away,"" I need bendable knees so I can kick the bitch to the curb.  Bendable knees would also be helpful for me in other situations - we've talked about this issue before. 

In closing, I would like to point out that any further concessions to the blond bimbo from hell will result in action being  taken by myself and others.  And Barbie can forget about having Joe - he's  mine... at least that's what he said last night.

Sincerely,

Ken","Holidays",3298,5

"Hi Erma,

This perfectly delightful note is being sent on paper I made myself to tell you what I have been up to. Since it snowed last night, I got up early and made a sled with old barn wood and a glue gun. I hand painted it in gold leaf, got out my loom, and made a blanket in peaches and mauves. Then to make the sled complete, I made a white horse to pull it, from DNA that I had just sitting around in my craft room.

By then, it was time to start making the place mats and napkins for my 20 breakfast guests. I'm serving the old standard Stewart twelve-course breakfast, but I'll let you in on a little secret: I didn't have time to make the tables and chairs this morning, so I used the ones I had on hand.

Before I moved the table into the dining room, I decided to add just a touch of the holidays. So I repainted the room in pinks and stenciled gold stars on the ceiling. Then, while the homemade bread was rising, I took antique candle molds and made the dishes (exactly the same shade of pink) to use for breakfast. These were made from Hungarian
clay, which you can get at almost any Hungarian craft store.

Well, I must run. I need to finish the buttonholes on the dress I'm wearing for breakfast. I'll get out the sled and drive this note to the post office as soon as the glue dries on the envelope I'll be making.

Hope my breakfast guests don't stay too long, I have 40,000 cranberries to string with bay leaves before my speaking engagement at noon. It's a good thing.

Love,
Martha Stewart

P.S. When I made the ribbon for this typewriter, I used 1/8-inch gold gauze. I soaked the gauze in a mixture of white grapes and blackberries which I grew, picked, and crushed last week just for fun.

"'Twas the night before Cat-mas and all through MY house,
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse...(I ate it).
My kitty stocking was hung by the cat door with care,
In hopes that Santa Claws soon would be there;
The humans were nestled all snug in their beds,
While we cats in the darkness danced on their heads;
Big Owner in his ""sleepy's"", and me his loyal cat,
Had just settled down for a long winter's nap,
When out in the 'hood there arose such a clatter,
I sprang to four paws to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Eating curtains and shades (I threw up the sash).
The street lamp outside shined eerily below,
Maybe two cats fighting?  Paw to paw, blow-by-blow?
No, wait!  What my sharp kitty eyes should detect,
But a miniature cat box, and that Devonshire Rex.
A little old driver, all hairy with paws,
I knew in an instant it must be Santa Claws.
More rapid than hairballs his coursers they came,
And he howled, he meowed, he called them by name;
""Now, BOMBAY! now, BIRMAN! RAGDOLL and BURMESE!
On, PIXIE-BOB! on KORAT! on, PERSIAN and SIAMESE!
To the top of the fence! To the top of the tree!
My felines are awaiting, they are all purring!""
As dry heaves that before the wild furballs fly,
When he meets with an obstacle, they jump to the sky,
So over my shingles the kitties they flew,
With the carriage full of cat morsels, and Santa Claws too.
With a turn of my ear, I heard on the roofpole
The scratching and clawing of each kitty's sole.
I drew in my head, and was spinning around,
When through the cat door Santa Claws did abound.
A long hair in fur, of course, from head to foot,
And his hairs were all shiny, well coiffured, nicely put.
A bundle of cat toys he had flung on his back,
You'd swear he was pedigree just him with his pack.
His eyes -- how they twinkled!  His whiskers how bold!
His cheek hairs so soft, his nose...oh, how cold!
He shed not a hair, each strand in its place
The most famous of all of the proud feline race.
The stump of some cat nip he held tight in his teeth,
Its aroma encircling his head like a wreath;
An imposing cat with the biggest belly in history,
That shook, when he laughed like a bowlful of Friskies.
A grimalkin of breed, a right jolly old cat!
Did I say grimalkin, how could I think that!
A twitch of the whisker and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;
He mewed not a sound, but went straight to his work,
Filled my stockings with kitty treats; then turned with a jerk,
And laying a talon aside of his nose,
After giving a nod, out the cat door he goes;
He sprang to his cat box, to his team gave ""MEOW!""
And away they all flew, like the wind they did howl.
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,
""MEOWY CAT-MAS TO ALL, AND TO ALL A GOOD-NIGHT!""","Holidays",3313,5
"Twas the nocturnal segment of the diurnal period preceding the annual
Yuletide celebration, and throughout our place of residence, kinetic activity
was not in evidence among the possessors of this potential, including the
species of domestic rodent known as Mus Musculus.

Hosiery was meticulously suspended from the forward edge of the wood
burning caloric apparatus pursuant to our anticipatory pleasure regarding
an imminent visitation from an eccentric philanthropist among whose folkloric
appellations is the honorific title of Saint Nicholas.

The prepubescent siblings, comfortably ensconced in their respective
accommodations of repose, were experiencing subconscious visual hallucinations
of variegated fruit confections moving rhythmically through their cerebrums.

My conjugal partner and I, attired in our nocturnal head coverings were
about to take slumberous advantage of the hibernal darkness when upon the
exterior portion of the grounds there ascended such a cacophony of dissonance
that I felt compelled to arise with alacrity from my place of repose for
the purpose of ascertaining the precise source thereof.

Hastening to the casement, I forthwith opened the barriers sealing this
fenestration. Noting hereupon that the lunar brilliance without, reflected
as it was on the surface of a recent crystalline precipitation, might be
said to rival that of the solar meridian itself. Thus permitting my incredulous
optical sensory organs to behold a miniature airborne runnered conveyance,
drawn by eight diminutive specimens of the genus Rangifer.

Piloted by a minuscule aged chauffer so ebullient and nimble that it
became instantly apparent to me that he was indeed our anticipated caller.

With his ungulate motive power traveling at what may have been more
vertiginous velocity than patriotic alar predators, he vociferated loudly,
expelled breath musically through contracted labia, and addressed each
of the octet by his or her respective cognomen: ""Now Dasher, now Dancer"",
et al..

Guiding them to the uppermost exterior level of our abode, through which
structure I could readily distinguish the concatenations of each of the
32 cloven pedal extremities. As I retracted my cranium from its erstwhile
location, and was performing a 180 degree pivot, our distinguished visitant
achieved -- with utmost celerity and via a downward leap -- entry by the
way of the smoke passage.

He was clad entirely in animal pelts soiled by the ebon residue from
oxidations of carboniferous fuels which had accumulated on the walls thereof.
His resemblance to a street vendor I attributed largely to the plethora
of assorted playthings which he bore dorsally in a commodious cloth receptacle.
His orbs were scintillating with reflected luminosity, while his submaxillary
dermal indentations gave every evidence of engaging amiability.

The capillaries of his molar regions and nasal protuberance were engorged
with blood which suffused in subcutaneous layers, the former approximating
the coloration of Albion's floral emblem, the later that of the Prunus
Avium, or Sweet Cherry.

His amusing sub- and supra-labials resembled nothing so much as a common
loop knot, and their ambient hirsute facial adornment appeared like small
tabular and columnar crystals being.

Clenched firmly between his incisors was a smoking piece whose gray
fumes, forming a tenuous ellipse about his occiput, were suggestive of
a decorative seasonal circlet of holly.

His visage was wider than it was high, and when he waxed audibly mirthful,
his corpulent abdominal region undulated in the manner of pectinous fruit
syrup in a hemispherical container.

He was, in short, neither more or less than obese, jocund, multigenarian
gnome, the optical perception of whom rendered me visibly frolicsome despite
every effort to refrain from so being.

By rapidly lowering and then elevating one eyelid and rotating his head
to one side he indicated that trepidation on my part was groundless.

Without utterance and with dispatch, he commenced filling the afore-mentioned
hosiery with various of the afore-mentioned articles of merchandise extracted
from his afore-mentioned previously dorsally transported cloth receptacle.

Upon completion of his task, he executed an abrupt about face, placed
a singular manual digit in lateral juxtaposition to his olfactory organ,
inclined his cranium forward in a gesture of leave-taking, and forthwith
effected his egress by renegotiating, in reverse, the smoke passage.

He propelled himself in short vector onto his conveyance, directed a
musical expulsion of air through his contracted oral sphincter to the antlered
quadrupeds of burden, and proceeded to soar aloft in a movement hitherto
observable chiefly among the seed-bearing portions of a common weed.

But I overheard his parting exclamation, audibly immediately prior to
his vehiculation beyond the limits of visibility:

""Ecstatic Yuletide to the planetary constituency, and to that self-same
assemblage, my sincerest wishes for a salubriously beneficial and gratifyingly
pleasurable period between sunset and dawn!""","Holidays",3314,4

"24. December 1999 - 57 Elm Street, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania - 11:51P.M.

Scully, we're too late. It's already been here.

Mulder, I hope you know what you're doing.

Look, Scully, just like the other homes: Douglas fir truncated, mounted, transformed into a shrine; halls decked with bows of holly; stocking hung by the chimney with care.

You really think someone's been here?

Someone, or something.

Mulder, over here, It's fruitcake.

Don't touch it! Those things can be lethal!

There's a note attached: ""gonna find out who's naughty and nice.""

It's judging them, Scully. It's making a list.

Who? What are you talking about?

Ancient mythology tells of an obese humanoid entity who could travel at great speed in a craft powered by antlered servants. Once each year just after the winter solstice, this creature is said to descend from the heavens to reward its followers and punish disbelievers with jagged chunks of anthracite.

But that's legend, Mulder, a story told by parents to frighten children. Surely you don't believe it?

Something was here tonight, Scully. Check out the bite marks on this gingerbread man. Whatever tore through this plate of cookies was massive and in a hurry.

It left crumbs everywhere. And look, Mulder this milk glass has been completely drained.

It gorged itself, Scully. It fed without remorse.

But why would they leave it milk and cookies?

Appeasement. Tonight is the Eve, and nothing can stop its wilding.

But if this thing does exist, how did it get in? The doors and windows were locked. There's no sign of forced entry.

Unless I miss my guess, it came through the fireplace. 

Wait a minute, Mulder. If you're saying some huge creature landed on the roof and came down this chimney, you're crazy. The flue is barely six inches wide, nothing could get through there.

But what if it could alter its shape, move in all directions at once?

You mean, like a bowl full of jelly?

Exactly. ...Scully, I've never told anyone this but when I was a child my home was visited. I saw the creature. It had long white shanks of fur surrounding its ruddy, misshaped head. Its bloated torso was red and white. I'll never forget the horror. I turned away and, when I looked back, it had somehow taken on the facial features of my father.

Impossible.

I know what I saw. And that night, it read my mind. It brought me a Mr. Potato Head, Scully. It knew that I wanted a Mr. Potato Head.

I'm sorry, Mulder, but you're asking me to disregard the laws of physics. You want me to believe in some supernatural being who soars across the skies and brings gifts to good little girls and boys. Listen to what you're saying. Do you understand the repercussions? If this gets out they'll close the X-files.

Scully, listen to me: It knows when you're sleeping. It knows when you're awake.
But we have no proof.

Last year on this exact date, SETI radio telescopes detected a bogey in the airspace over twenty seven states. The White House ordered a condition red.

But that was a meteor shower.

Officially. Two days ago eight prized Scandinavian reindeer vanished from the National Zoo in Washington D.C. Nobody, not even the zoo keeper was told about it. The government doesn't want people to know about Project Kringle.

They fear that if this thing is proved to exist the public will stop spending half its annual income in a holiday shopping frenzy. Retail markets will collapse. Scully, they cannot let the world believe this creature lives. There's too much at stake.. They'll
do what ever it takes to insure another silent night.

Mulder...

"Good afternoon.  I'm Al Gore, and I'd like to tell you about myself.  I know a lot about hardship, because I came into this world as a poor black child in a tiny town in the backwoods of Tennessee.  I was born in a log cabin that I built with my own hands.  I taught myself to read by candlelight and helped support my 16 brothers and sisters by working summers as a deck hand on a Mississippi River steamboat.

My mother taught me the value of education, so every day; I would walk 5 miles to a one-room schoolhouse.  I was a mischievous, fun-loving scamp, though I never dreamed that one-day, my youthful escapades would serve as the inspiration for ""Huckleberry Finn"".

Back then, black folks in the South were second-class citizens. One day, a traveling minister came through town, and I asked him if anyone was ever going to do something to guarantee civil rights for all Americans. Well, I guess I made an impression. You see, the minister's name was Martin Luther King, Jr.

My father was a United States Senator. He once perched me on his knee and said, ""Son, if you work hard and listen to your mama, someday you can live in a hotel in Washington, D.C., and go to an exclusive prep school.""

But life of privilege was not for me.  After getting my high school diploma, I took a job in a hot, dirty textile mill.  I was so appalled at the treatment of the workers there that I organized a union.  Later, that experience inspired a movie - which is why, to this day, my close friends at the AFL-CIO call me ""Norma Rae"".

When word got out what an 18 year old factory worker had done, Harvard called and offered me a scholarship.  I captained the hockey team to four consecutive national championships, but I also played football and was good enough to win the Heisman Trophy.  During my college years, I lived in a housing project and moonlighted playing lead guitar for a little rock band.  You may have heard of it -- the Rolling Stones.

But there was a war going on, and I felt I had to serve my country. So I enlisted in the U. S. Army and went to Vietnam.  I was deeply opposed to the war, but I did my duty as a soldier and came back home with the Medal of Honor and the Croix de Guerre.

When I got back, I took a long journey across this great land of ours.  I've crossed the deserts bare, man, I've breathed the mountain air, man, I've traveled, I've done my share, man, I've been everywhere.  And the people I met at truckstops and campgrounds and homeless shelters on that journey all said the same thing: ""Al, we need you in Washington.""

I knew they were right, but first I had to take care of some other business -- building the World Trade Center, founding the Audubon Society, doing the clinical research that proved smoking caused cancer, and coming up with the recipe for Mrs. Field's chocolate chip cookies.

Finally, I deferred to the demands of the people of Tennessee and allowed them to elect me to the House of Representatives and the Senate, where I established the US Strategic Oil Reserve.  And then one winter day nearly nine years ago, for no particular
reason, I answered the call of the people once again and took the oath of office as Vice President of the United States.

Since then, I've been part of the most successful administration in American history. And, in my spare time, I invented the Internet. Many times Bill Clinton has been pondering some grave decision and has asked me what to do.  And when I would give him
my thoughts, he would invariable say, ""Of course.  That's brilliant.  Why didn't I think of that?"" During the darkest days of the impeachment battle, the president told me he only wished he had listened when I told him to stay away from that dark-haired intern.

So after I decided to run for president, I sat down with him and asked if he had any suggestions about how to conduct my campaign.  And Bill Clinton gave me a few simple words of advice -- words I'll never forget.  He looked me in the eye and he said, ""Al, just tell the truth, it's always worked for me.""","Political",3335,4

After knocking at the gates, St. Peter appeared. ""Who goes there?"" inquired St. Peter.

""'Tis I, your lordship, President Bill Clinton.""

""And what do you want?"" asked St. Peter.

""Lemme in!"" replied Clinton.

""Soooo,"" pondered Peter. ""What bad things did you do on earth?""

Clinton thought a bit and answered, ""Well, I smoked marijuana-but you
shouldn't hold that against me because I didn't inhale. I guess I had
extramarital sex-but you shouldn't hold that against me because I didn't
really have sexual relations. And I lied, but I didn't commit perjury.""

"A man went to a doctor, and said he wanted to be able to get a job at the local Post Office, but unfortunately he was too smart. The doctor asked him his IQ, and when he gave a three-digit reply, the doctor told him that the procedure would have to involve the removal of over half of his brain.

The man insisted, and since the doctor just happened to have a brand new laser device which could zap just the right portions of brain tissue, the operation was planned.

The laser was hooked up to a computer which could monitor the man's declining IQ on a nice bright LED display.  The doctor threw the switch and the numbers began ticking off ... 95, 94, 93, ...

Suddenly the phone rang.  It was the doctor's wife.  They gabbed for a few minutes, the doctor forgetting completely about his patient.

When he hung up, he suddenly realized, and ran into the operating room, only to see the meter tick down ...  6, 5, 4, ...

He ran to the machine and threw the on/off switch, just as the laser was about to wipe out the last remnant of brain.  ""Holy moley!"" exclaimed the doctor, ""What have I done?  Speak to me. Say anything!""

President Bush's ""Don't Ask, Just Give 'em Hell"" policy is a sharp departure from former President Clinton's focus on moving the Pentagon to San Francisco and painting Navy
battleships a bright lavender.

The President was particularly pleased that it was a 50's era propeller driven plane that took out the Chinese aircraft. ""Heck, we bought and paid for that sucker fifty years ago. It didn't cost the American taxpayer a single dime to take out that commie.""

Bush was also pleased his ""Ram The Bastard"" policy for Navy submarines was a rousing success.  ""Just think of all of the torpedoes we can save money on!""  The President seemed only momentarily flustered when asked if the Navy should, perhaps, target enemies of the United States instead of friendly countries like Japan.

"In new documents just revealed by the Justice Department, in addition to the controversial pardon of fugitive Marc Rich, former President Clinton also pardoned Adolph Hitler and Satan. With minutes to go before his term expired, Clinton signed an order to pardon himself.

Clinton's press liaison defended the pardons.  ""President Clinton reasoned it's time to put this whole 'World War' thing behind us.

""While Hitler did indeed have a few bad years, he's been a model of civility for the last 56 years.  We think he deserves a second chance.""

Clinton seemed to identify with Hitler.  ""There were forces constantly at work against him.  I'm not condoning what he did, mind you, but I feel his pain.  I know exactly what it's like to have the media of the world against you.""

Clinton's pardon of Satan drew some right-wing Republican protests.  Representative Dan Burton called upon Clinton to appear before Congress and explain the action.  Burton
believes there was a deal between the Prince of Darkness and Clinton to help build Clinton's Presidential Library in exchange for the pardon and Clinton's soul.

Democrats were quick to dismiss the charges.  Senator Tom Daschle said, ""These charges are bogus because President Clinton sold his soul to Satan years ago.""

"Effective immediately, the company is adopting Fridays as 
Casual Day so that employees may express their diversity. 


Spandex and leather micro-miniskirts are not appropriate attire for Casual Day. Neither are string ties, rodeo belt buckles or moccasins. 


Casual Day refers to dress only, not attitude. When planning Friday's wardrobe, remember image is a key to our success. 


A seminar on how to dress for Casual Day will be held at 4  p.m. Friday in the cafeteria. Fashion show to follow. 
Attendance is mandatory. 


As an outgrowth of Friday's seminar, the Committee On
Committee's has appointed a 14-member Casual Day Task
Force to prepare guidelines for proper dress. 


The Casual Day Task Force has completed a 30-page manual. 
A copy of ""Relaxing Dress Without Relaxing Company

"FROM: Pat Smith, Human Resources Director
TO: Everyone  RE: Christmas Party DATE: December 1

I'm happy to inform you that the company Christmas Party will take place on December 23, starting at noon in the banquet room at Luigi's Open Pit Barbecue. No-host bar, but plenty of eggnog! We'll have a small band playing  traditional carols -- feel free to sing along. And don't be surprised if our CEO shows up dressed as Santa Claus!


DATE: December 2 RE: Christmas Party

In no way was yesterday's memo intended to exclude our Jewish employees.  We recognize that Chanukah is an important holiday which often coincides with Christmas, though unfortunately not this year. However, from now on we're calling it our ""Holiday Party."" The same policy applies to employees who are celebrating Kwanzaa at this time.  Happy
now?


DATE: December 3 RE: Holiday Party

Regarding the note I received from a member of Alcoholics Anonymous requesting a non-drinking table ... you didn't sign your name.  I'm happy to accommodate this request, but if I put a sign  on a table that reads, ""AA Only""; you wouldn't be anonymous anymore. How am I supposed to handle this? Somebody?


DATE: December 7 RE: Holiday Party

What a  diverse company we are! I had no idea that December 20 begins the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which forbids eating, drinking and intimacy during daylight hours.  There goes the party!  Seriously, we can appreciate how a luncheon this time of year does not accommodate our Muslim employees' beliefs. Perhaps Luigi's can hold off on serving your meal until the end of the party-the days are so short this time of year-or else package everything for take-home in little foil swans. Will that work?  Meanwhile, I've arranged for members of Overeaters Anonymous to sit farthest from the dessert buffet and pregnant women will get the table closest to the restrooms.  Did I miss anything?


DATE: December 8  RE: Holiday Party

So December 22 marks the Winter Solstice...what do you expect me to do, a tap-dance on your heads? Fire regulations at Luigi's prohibit the burning of sage by our ""earth-based
Goddess-worshipping"" employees, but we'll try to accommodate your shamanic drumming circle during the band's breaks. Okay???


Date: December 9  RE: Holiday Party

People, people, nothing sinister was intended by having our CEO dress up like Santa Claus! Even if the anagram of ""Santa"" does happen to be ""Satan,"" there is no evil connotation to our own ""little man in a red suit.""  It's a tradition, folks, like sugar 
shock at Halloween or family feuds over the Thanksgiving turkey or broken hearts on Valentine's Day.  Could we lighten up?


DATE: December 10  RE: Holiday Party

Vegetarians!?!?!? I've had it with you people!!! We're going to keep this party at Luigi's Open Pit Barbecue whether you like it or not, so you can sit quietly at the table  furthest from the ""grill of death,"" as you so quaintly put it, and you'll get your #$%^&*! salad bar, including hydroponic tomatoes...but you know, they have feelings, too.  Tomatoes scream when you slice them. I've heard them scream, I'm hearing them scream right now!


DATE:  December 14  RE: Pat Smith and Holiday Party

I'm sure I speak for all of us in wishing Pat Smith a speedy recovery from her stress-related illness and I'll continue to forward your cards to her at the sanitarium.  In the meantime, management has decided to cancel our Holiday Party and give everyone the afternoon of the 23rd off with full pay.  Happy Chanuk-Kwanzaa-Solsti-Rama-Mas.","Business",3450,2

"A local business was looking for office help. They put a sign in the
window, stating the following:  ""HELP WANTED. Must be able to type, 
must be good with a computer and must be bilingual. We are an Equal 
Opportunity Employer.""

A short time afterwards, a dog trotted up to the window, saw the sign
and went inside.  He looked at the receptionist and wagged his tail,
then walked over to the sign, looked at it and whined. Getting the 
idea, the receptionist got the office manager. The office manager 
looked at the dog and was  surprised, to say the least. However, 
the dog looked determined, so he lead him into the office. Inside, 
the dog jumped up on the chair and stared at the manager. The manager
said, ""I can't hire you. The sign says you have to be able to type.""

The dog jumped down, went to the typewriter and proceeded to type 
out a perfect letter.  He took out the page, trotted over to the 
manager, gave it to him, then jumped back on the chair. The manager 
was stunned, but then told the dog, ""The sign says you have to be 
good with a computer.""

The dog jumped down again and went to the computer. The dog proceeded to
enter and execute a perfect program, that worked flawlessly the first
time it ran.

By now, the manager was totally dumb-founded! He looked at the dog 
and said, ""I realize that you are a very intelligent dog and have 
some interesting abilities.  However, I *still* can't give you the 
job.""  The dog  jumped down and went to a copy of the sign and put 
his paw on the sentence that told about being an Equal Opportunity 
Employer. The manager said, ""Yes, but the sign *also* says that you 
have to be bilingual"".

The dog looked at the manager calmly and said ""Meow.""","Business",3458,4

"AMES, IA--The heaviest element known to science was recently discovered by materials researchers at IPRT/ISU. The new element, tentatively named Administratium, has no protons or electrons, and thus has an atomic weight of 0. However, it does have one neuron, 125 assistant neutrons, 75 vice neutrons, and 111 assistant vice neutrons. This gives it an atomic mass of 312. These 312 particles are held together in a nucleus by a force that involves the continuous exchange of particles called morons.

Since it has no electrons, Administratium is totally inert. However, it can be detected chemically, since it impedes every reaction it comes into contact with. According to its discovers, a tiny amount of Administratium caused one reaction to take over four days to complete; the normal reaction time is less than one second.

Administratium has a normal half life of approximately three years, at which time it does not actually decay, but instead undergoes a reorganization in which neutrons, vice neutrons, and assistant vice neutrons exchange places. Studies have shown that the atomic mass usually increases after each reorganization.

Research at other laboratories indicates that Administratium occurs naturally in the atmosphere. It tends to concentrate at certain points, such as governmental agencies, large corporations, and universities. It is always found in the newest, best appointed, and best maintained buildings.

Scientists point out that Administratium is known to be toxic at any level of concentration and can easily destroy any productive reactions where it is allowed to accumulate. Attempts are being made to determine how Administratium can be controlled to prevent irreversible damage, but results to date are not promising.","Business",3473,3

"FROM: OPERATIONS
SUBJECT: Restroom Use Policy

In the past, employees were permitted to make trips to the restroom under informal guidelines. Effective immediately, a Restroom Trip Policy will be established to provide a more consistent method of accounting for each employee's restroom time and ensuring equal treatment of all employees.

Under the policy a ""Restroom Trip Bank"" will be established for each employee. The first day of each month, employees will be given twenty Restroom Trip Credits. These credits may be accumulated.

Within four to six weeks, the entrance doors to all restrooms are being equipped with personal identification stations and computer-linked voice print recognition devices. Before the end of the month each employee must provide two copies of voice prints (one normal and one under stress) to the Human Resources Department. The voice print recognition station will be operational but not restrictive during the entire month. Employees should acquaint themselves with the stations during that period.

If the employee's Restroom Trip Bank balance reaches zero, the doors to the restrooms will not unlock for that employee's voice until the first of the next month. In addition, all restroom stalls are being equipped with timed paper roll retractors. If the stall is occupied for more than three minutes, an alarm will sound. Thirty-seconds after the alarm sounds, the roll of paper will retract into the wall, the toilet will flush, and the stall door will open. If the stall remains occupied, your picture will be taken.

The picture will then be posted on the bulletin board located in the Employee Relations Office. Anyone's picture showing up three times will immediately be terminated. If you have any questions about this policy, please ask your supervisor. They have all received advanced instructions.","Business",3486,4

"In our complex technical environment there are many opportunities for a competent technical individual to be the subject of technical harassment. Sometimes it can be so subtle that you may not even be aware you are being harassed. Worse yet, you may inadvertently technically harass another person by accident.

Following are some guidelines to help you determine if you are being technically harassed.

If you are repeatedly asked the same technical question you may be the victim of technical harassment.  While it is most common to be asked the question repeatedly within the same conversation, some instances have been identified of habitual technical harassment.  Habitual technical harassment is not uncommon and has been known to exhibit group tendencies where members of a group may ask the same question repeatedly.  Untreated, these instances of group technical harassment can continue for years.

If you are asked a technical question by a non-technical person and they do not write your answer down it is likely the question is frivolous.  Most non-technical people are not capable of remembering a true technical answer for more than 30 seconds.

If you are forced into a discussion where a person uses more than three (3) buzzwords in one sentence the person is most likely a fake and you are the unwitting victim of technical harassment.  One note of caution, competent technical people have been known to
inadvertently use buzzwords after reading mindless drivel like PC Week or LAN Times.  If the person has been known to use more common technical terms in the past such as ""stuff"" and ""things"", they are most likely victim of computer magazine brainwashing.

If during a troubleshooting session a person uses the term ""trick"".  For example ""maybe we could trick the database into thinking it has been updated"". This is a sure sign of technical harassment.

If a person explains that a needed feature will be provided by a vendor and that person is nontechnical then you are at risk of being technically harassed. If you believe that person, you have definitely been technically harassed, if you don't believe them you
have only been technically annoyed.

If when trying to resolve a technical problem with a product from a vendor and you are instructed to call the salesman that sold us the product you are being set up for technical harassment.  It is a common reaction for a non-technical person when they have
purchased technical equipment to call another non-technical person.  The dialogue between two nontechnical people usually provides some sense of comfort that they aren't the only ones who are confused.","Business",3517,4

"According to the FBI, most modern-day bank robberies are ""unsophisticated and unprofessional crimes,"" committed by young male repeat offenders who apparently don't know the first thing about their business. This information was included in an interesting, amusing article titled ""How Not to Rob a Bank,"" by Tim Clark, which appeared in the 1987 edition of The Old Farmers Almanac. Clark reported that in spite of the widespread use of surveillance cameras, 76 percent of bank robbers use no disguise, 86 percent never study the bank before robbing it, and 95 percent make no long-range plans for concealing the loot. Thus, he offered this advice to would-be bank robbers, along with examples of what can happen if the rules aren't followed:","Police Jokes",3585,5

Appearing at the hearing, God was asked why he began his earthly project in the first place. He replied that he just liked to be creative. Then God said, ""Let there be light"", and immediately the officials demanded to know how the light would be made. Would there be strip mining? 


What about thermal pollution? God explained that the light would come from a huge ball of fire. God was granted provisional permission to make light, assuming that no smoke would result from the ball of fire: that he would obtain a building permit; and to conserve energy, would have the light out half the time. God agreed and said he would call the light ""Day"" and the darkness ""Night"". Officials replied that they were not interested in semantics. 


God said, ""Let the earth bring forth green herb and such as many seed"". The EPA agreed so long as native seed was used. Then God said, ""Let waters bring forth creeping creatures having life; and the fowl that may fly over the earth"". 


Officials pointed out this would require approval from the Department of Game coordinated with the Heavenly Wildlife Federation and the Audubongelic Society. 


Everything was fine until God said he wanted to complete the project in Six days. Officials said it would take at least 200 days to review the application and impact statement. After that there would be a public hearing. Then there would be 10-12 months before...

God:  And have you been doing your Faith updates with Weekly Services?

Sinner:  Well, no, not all of them, but I did get the big upgrade at Christmas and Easter, and a few other Weekly Services here and there.

God:  Have you recently heard any contrary Data that might have corrupted your faith?

Sinner:  Not that I can think of...

God:  Please remember that corrupting data can come in many forms, from Simple Lies *(Microsoft) or Street Rhetoric (Internet), then there is that Guy Morgan at Just 4 Laughs Humor List!  Have your Ears downloaded anything that might be construed as corrupting?

Sinner:  Well I did listen to a bum on the street that said that God was asleep and that anyone who believes was being lulled into the fires of hell.

God:  What you have is a paradox, that is the problem with your faith, you see, somehow you have an INI string installed that does not let you Believe in God, but the output of this string is a Goto Hell.  Without God there is no hell, thus the paradox.

Sinner:  And how do I get this Paradox out of my system?

God:  Please re-read the book that came with your faith, The Bible\u00ae and recall the passages that deal with heaven and hell, and look to the passages about Judas.ini.  You can also find some help in the Psalms 100-120, but those are long and confusing and should only be used with a complete lack of Faith.

Why, the guy behind me started to honk like crazy, he must really love
the Lord. Because pretty soon he leaned out the window and yelled ""Jesus
Christ"" as loud as he could. It was like a football game with him shouting,
""Go Jesus Christ, Go"". Everyone else started honking too. So I leaned out
my window and waved and smiled to all those loving people.

There must have been a guy from Florida back there because
I could hear him yelling something about a Sunny Beach, and I saw him waving
in a funny way with only his middle finger up in the air. I had recently
asked my two kids what that meant. They told me that it was the Hawaiian
Good Luck Sign. So I leaned out the window and gave him the Good Luck Sign
back. A couple of people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that
they got out of their cars and were walking toward me. I bet they wanted
to pray.

But just then I noticed that the light had changed, and
I stepped on the gas. It's a good thing I did, because I was the only car

"At an interfaith retreat some time ago, the organizers decided to allow for a free afternoon of just socializing.  A priest, minister, and a rabbi went fishing together.

After a while, the priest said, ""Brother, Rabbi, would you please both excuse me, I've got to pee.""  He laid down his fishing pole, stepped over the side of the boat, and *walked across the water to the shore.*  He finished his business, then *walked back across the water* to the boat.

"Now, sit right back, and hear a tale.  A tale of a fateful trip. That started from a tropic port, aboard a tiny ship.  They were four men, who lived together, but they were all alone.

They'd sing, ""Fish don't fry in the kitchen, beans don't burn on the grill, took a whole lot of trying', just to get up that hill.""

She was bringing up three very lovely girls.  All of them had hair of gold, like their mother.  The youngest one in curls. They got tired of packing and unpacking, town to town, and up and down the dial.

'Til the one day when the lady met this fellow. And they knew it was much more than a hunch.  He said, ""Making your way in the world today takes everything you've got.  Taking a break from all your worries sure would help a lot.""

The guys promised they were good old boys.  Never meaning no harm.  They were creepy and kooky.  Mysterious and kooky.  All together ooky.

The gals responded, ""People say we monkey around.  But we're too busy singing to try to put anybody down.""

The skipper, brave and sure, five passengers set sail that day, for a three hour tour.  A three hour tour.  The weather started getting rough.  The tiny ship was tossed.  They all sang, ""One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Schlemeel, schlemazel, hasenfeffer incorporated."" 

The ship set ground on the shore of this uncharted desert isle.  Land spreading out so far and wide.  The lady said, ""Keep Manhattan, just give me that countryside.""

Once on land, the lady said, ""I've been down this road, walking down the line that's painted by pride.""  This fellow said, ""This is it.  This is it.  This is life, the one you got, so go and have a ball.""  He told her, ""Who can take a nothing day, and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile?""

Time passed.  Then, one day, as he was shooting at some food, up through the ground came a bubblin' crude.  Oil, that is.  Black gold.  Texas tea.

"August 1998 - Montevideo, Uruguay - Paolo Esperanza, bass-trombonist with the Simphonica Mayor de Uruguay, in a misplaced moment of inspiration, decided to make his own contribution to the cannon shots fired as part of the orchestra's performance of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture at an outdoorchildren's concert.

In complete seriousness he placed a large, ignited firecracker, supposedly equivalent in strength to a quarter stick of dynamite, into his aluminum straight mute and then stuck the mute into the bell of his quite new Yamaha in-line double-valve bass trombone. 

Later, from his hospital bed he explained to a reporter through bandages on his mouth, ""I thought that the bell of my trombone would shield me from the explosion and instead, would focus the energy of the blast outwards and away from me, propelling the mute
high above the orchestra, like a rocket.""

However, Paolo was not up on his propulsion physics nor qualified to use high-powered artillery. In his haste to get the horn up before the firecracker went off, he failed to raise the bell of the horn high enough so as to give the mute enough arc to clear the orchestra.

What actually happened should serve as a lesson to us all during those delirious moments of divine inspiration. First, because he failed to sufficiently elevate the bell of his horn, the blast propelled the mute between rows of players in the woodwind and viola sections of the orchestra, missing the players and straight into the stomach of the conductor, driving him off the podium and directly into the front row of the audience.

Fortunately, the audience were sitting in folding chairs and thus they were protected from serious injury, for the chairs collapsed under them, passing the energy of the impact of the flying conductor backwards into row of people sitting behind them, who in turn were driven back into the people in the row behind and so on, like a row of dominos. The sound  of collapsing wooden chairs and grunts of people falling on their behinds increased logarithmically, adding to the overall sound of brass cannons and brass playing as constitutes the closing measures of the Overture.

Meanwhile, all of this unplanned choreography notwithstanding, back on stage Paolo's Waterloo was still unfolding. According to Paolo, ""Just as I heard the sound of the blast, time seemed to stand still. Everything moved in slow motion. Just before I felt
searing pain to my mouth, I could swear I heard a voice with an Austrian accent say, 'Fur every akshon zer iz un eekvul unopposeet reakshon!'"" 

Well, this should come as no surprise, for Paolo had set himself up for a textbook demonstration of this fundamental law of physics. Having failed to plug the lead pipe of his trombone, he allowed the energy of the blast to send a superheated jet of gas backwards through the tubing of the trombone, through the mouthpiece, burning his lips and face.

The pyrotechnic ballet wasn't over yet. The force of the blast was so great it split the bell of his shiny Yamaha right down the middle, turning it inside out, while at the same time propelling Paolo backwards off the riser. And for the grand finale, as Paolo fell backwards he lost his grip on the slide of the trombone, allowing the pressure of the hot gases coursing through the horn to propel the trombone's slide like a double golden spear into the head of the 3rd clarinetist, knocking him unconscious.

The moral of the story? Beware the next time you hear someone in the horn section yell out ""Hey, everyone, watch this!""","Miscellaneous",3691,2

I replied, ""I'm sorry, he's not in right now. Can I take a message?""

""Do you know what time he'll be back?"" she responded.

""I think he said he'd be home around 10:00.""

Silence on the other end... a confused silence.

""Is this Steve?""

My name isn't Steve, either.  This was definitely a wrong number.

""Well... he said he would be home tonight and asked me to call him,"" she said in a slightly irritated voice.

I replied, ""Well, he went out with Karen about an hour ago, and said that he would be back at 10:00.""

""Yes... please do.  Tell him to call me when he gets home.""

She exploded, ""Who's Jennifer?""

Apparently she wasn't.

""Well... he's going out with Jennifer at 10:00.  I thought you were her.  Sorry... it was an honest mistake.""

""Ben's the one that's made the mistake!  Tell him that Alice called him and the she's very upset and that I would like him to call me as soon as he gets home.""

She informed me that she could not complete the transaction unless the

to compare the signature on the credit card with the signature I just
signed on the receipt. So I signed the credit card in front of her. She
carefully compared that signature to the one I signed on the receipt. As

Send this to 5 people in the next 47 seconds.  Oh, and a reminder- if
you accidentally send this to 4 or 6 people, you will die instantly and
a mad goat will rape your dead body.  Thanks again!!










Wasn't that fun?  Hope you made a great wish.  Now, to make you feel
guilty, here's what I'll do.  First of all, if you don't send this to a
certain number of people in the next 5 seconds, you will be raped by a
mad goat and then thrown off a high building into a pile of manure.
It's true!   Because , you now, THIS letter isn't like all of those fake
ones, THIS one is TRUE!! Really!!! Here's how it goes.

Send this to 1 person: One person will be upset with you for sending
them a stupid chain letter.

Send this to 2-5 people: 2-5 people will be upset with you for sending

Queer Horror Story #1 Miranda Pinsley was walking home from school on
Saturday. She had recently received this letter and ignored it.  She
then tripped in a crack in the side walk, fell into the sewer, was
gushed down a drainpipe in a flood of poop, and went flying out over a
waterfall.  Not only did she smell nasty, she died. This Could Happen To
You!!!

Queer Horror Story #2 Dexter Bip, a 13 year old boy, got a chain letter
in his mail and ignored it .  Later that day, he was hit by a car and so
was his boyfriend (hey, some people swing that way, especially at
Oklahoma City University).  They both died and went to hell. They
continued to suffer in hell where they were both cursed to eat adorable
kittens every day for eternity.  This Could Happen To You!!!

Remember, you could end up like Pinsley and Bip did.  Just send this
letter to all of your loser friends, and everything will be Ok.

Of course, there's the guy in Peoria Illinois who DID forward this on
and then he married his secret crush, they moved to the suburbs, had 2.3
children and lived happily ever after.

Right up until he started working late every night, started an affair
with his secretary and boozing.  Then she started sleeping with the golf
pro at the local country club, became addicted to sleeping pills and
their 2.3 children got into gangs and drugs. Then everything went to
hell, and they got divorced.  She got the house and the kids, and he got
the car and child support payment, and got to keep the mortgage payment,
lost his job and his car and now is working the midnight shift at the
local McDonald's.




As if you care, here is a poem that I wrote.  Send it to every one of
your friends.


 - A friend is someone who is always at your side, - A friend is
someone who likes you even though you smell like a wet dog, - A friend
is someone who likes you even though you're disgustingly ugly, - A
friend is someone who cleans up for you after you've soiled yourself, -
A friend is someone who stays with you all night while you cry about
your loser life, - A friend is someone who pretends they like you when
they really think you should be raped by a mad goat and then thrown
to vicious dogs, - A friend is someone who scrubs your toilet and
vacuums and then gets the check and leaves and doesn't speak much
English no, sorry that's the cleaning lady,

Now pass this on! If you don't, Satan will send dogs in heat to your
room in your sleep!!



Remember, the moral of the story is, if you get a chain letter, ignore
it.

TRASH IT!!!  If it's a joke or something, send it, sure! Just don't
forget to delete the chain letter part.  But if it's gonna make people
feel guilty  (i.e. the willieless boy from Baklaliviatatlaglooshen) or
nervous (i.e. Miranda Pinsley who ended up in a waterfall of poop), just
DELETE it.

Do yourself a favor, and everyone else in the world, and say NO!!! to

"A Twinkie was left on a window ledge for 4 days, during which time an inch
and a half of rain fell. Many flies were observed crawling across the Twinkie's
surface, but contrary to hypothesis, birds -- even pigeons -- avoided this
potential source of substance.

Despite the rain and prolonged exposure to the sun, the Twinkie retained
its original color and form. When removed, the Twinkie was found to be
substantially dehydrated. Cracked open, it was observed to have taken on
the consistency of industrial foam insulation; the filling however, retained
its advertised ""creaminess""


A Twinkie was placed in a conventional microwave oven, which was set for
precisely 4 minutes -- the approximate cooking time of bacon. After 20
seconds, the oven began to emit the Twinkie's rich, characteristic aroma
of artificial butter. After one minute, this aroma began to resemble the
acrid smell of burning rubber. The experiment was aborted after 2 minutes
10 seconds when thick, foul smoke began billowing from the top of the oven.
A second Twinkie was subjected to the same experiment; this Twinkie leaked
molten white filling. When cooled, this now epoxylike filling bonded the
Twinkie to its plate, defying gravity: it was removed only upon application
of a butter knife.


A Twinkie was dropped from a ninth-floor window, a fall of approximately
120 feet. It landed right side up, then bounced onto its back. The expected
""splatter"" effect was not observed. Indeed, the only discernible damage
to the Twinkie was a narrow fissure on its underside; otherwise, the Twinkie
remained structurally intact.


A Twinkie was placed in a conventional freezer for 24 hours. Upon removal,
the Twinkie was not found to be frozen solid, but its physical properties
had noticeably ""slowed"". The filling was found to be the approximate consistency
of acrylic paint, while exhibiting the mercurylike property of not adhering
to practically any surface. It was noticed the Twinkie had generously absorbed
the freezer odors.


A Twinkie was exposed to a gas flame for 2 minutes. While the Twinkie smoked
and blackened and the filling in one of its ""cream holes"" boiled, the Twinkie
did not catch fire. It did, however produce the same ""burning rubber"" aroma
noticed in the irradiation experiment.


A Twinkie was dropped into a large bucket filled with water, the Twinkie
floated momentarily, then began to list and sink. Viscous yellow tendrils
ran off its lower half, possibly consisting of a water-soluble artificial
coloring. After 2 hours, the Twinkie bloated substantially. Its coloring
was now a very pale tan -- in contrast to the yellow, urine-like water
that surrounded it. The Twinkie bobbed when touched, and had a gelatinous
texture. After 72 hours the Twinkie had increased roughly 200 percent of
its original size. The water had turned opaque, and a small, fan-shaped
spray of filling had leaked from one of the ""cream holes"". Unfortunately,
efforts to remove the Twinkie for further analysis were abandoned when,
under light pressure the Twinkie disintegrated into an amorphous cloud
of debris. A distinctly sour odor was noted.


The Twinkie's survival of a 120-foot drop, along with some of the unusual
phenomena associated with the ""creamy filling"" and artificial coloring,
should give pause to those observers who would unequivocally categorize
the Twinkie as ""food"". Further clinical inquiry is required before any
definite conclusions can be drawn.

"A medieval king was doing battle with the neighboring kingdom and had the chance to defeat his enemy if he could get a message out to his allies further south.  He called his knights together and requested a volunteer to carry this entreaty.

Immediately a tall and brave knight stepped forward and announced he would gladly volunteer his services.  It was with much fanfare that the knight mounted his steed, the secret message in his saddlepack, and headed out across the drawbridge.  Out of the clouds came a giant yellow hand that snatched both the knight and his steed off the drawbridge, crushed them both, and deposited their remains into the alligator filled moat below.

A somber hush fell over the castle.  The king again requested a volunteer to save his kingdom.  And another knight stepped forward, willing to risk his life for the glory of serving his king and kingdom.  Much concern and hoopla went on as he mounted his steed, deposited the secret message in his saddlebag, and headed out across the draw bridge.  And AGAIN this enormous yellow hand swooped down out of the clouds, snatching him off the drawbridge, crushing him and depositing him in the alligator filled moat.

The king was at a loss as surely he would lose the battle and his kingdom in the process.  No other knights would step forward.  The king offerred his daughter's hand and half his kingdom to whoever could dispatch the message to his allies.

A small page stepped forward, caring little about the kingdom but possessing an intense desire for the princess. ""I'll do it,"" he said, as he took the entreaty and placed it in the purse pages were wont to carry in those days.

The drawbridge was lowered and he scampered across as fast as his little legs would carry him.  As before, down swoops this giant yellow hand, grabbing for the page as he
raced along, but as luck would have it, his size worked to his advantage, and he slipped between the fingers, reached the other side of the drawbridge and disappeared into the
safety of the forest.  The message was successfully delivered, the war was won, and he lived happily ever after with the princess on his half of the kingdom.

"The Pope and the Queen of England are on the same stage at an Anglican and Catholic commemoration of the Anglo-Irish accords. The crowd is huge - thousands. Her Majesty and His Holiness, can't help but have a little rivalry, both being heads of churches and all.

The Queen says to the Pope, ""Did you know that with just one little wave of my hand I can make every English person in the crowd go wild?""

He doubts it, so she shows him. Sure enough, the royal-gloved wave elicits rapture and cheering from every Englishman in the crowd. Gradually the cheering subsides.

The Pope, not wanting to be outdone by someone wearing a worse frock and hat than he, considers what he could do. So the Pope says to the Queen, ""Your Majesty, that was impressive. But did you know that with one little wave of MY hand I can make every Irish person in the crowd go crazy with joy? Their joy will not be a momentary display like that of your subjects, but will go deep into their hearts, and they will speak forever of this day and rejoice. They will recount it to their grandchildren and they to their descendants.""

The Queen seriously doubts this, and says so. ""One little wave of your hand and all Irish people will rejoice forever? Show me.""

"Letter to Xerox and the Reply

Dear Kings of Kopiers:(feel free to use that) I just started a new job as an exterminator's assistant, and part of my job is mailing out invoices to our clients.  Today, while printing all the invoices, I ran out of printer paper, so I ran down to the local office supply store and picked up several boxes of Xerox MultiUse Paper.

While the invoices were printing, I noticed something on the package of paper that concerned me, and I thought I'd better check with you about it. On the box, there is a little thing that says 99.99% jam free.  I know that sometimes wood finds its way into paper, but jam? I was always taught to keep all food and drinks away from
computer equipment, especially something as sticky as jam.

Now, I realize that it is a very small amount of jam in each piece of paper, but we use an awful LOT of paper, my friends, and all that jam is sure to add up.  Won't that adversely affect the life of our printer?  I mean, I'm sure you know what you're doing when it comes to paper, but we use more than the average consumer, so maybe we would be better off with a ""Jam-free"" paper, if you offer such a product.  I will look for it next time I am shopping, which will be soon, as I don't want to use any more of this paper until I find out if it's really safe.

If it is safe, why not say ""Contains .01% jam, but it's perfectly safe"" in big letters, since I'm sure that I am not the only one who has this concern.  You may end up selling a lot more paper that way.

By the way, I'm curious as to why you would even put jam in paper. Does it help bond everything together so it doesn't look like confettii? Just curious.  Also, I'd appreciate a Xerox keychain.

Thanks,

Thank you for your message.
We greatly appreciate your taking the time to send us your feedback regarding our 99.99% jam free paper.  We have restricted the manufacture of paper to the morning because we have so many folks who eat jam for lunch.  Nevertheless, it has been our experience that small amounts of jam have found its way into the paper via morning bagels and jam-filled
donuts.

Our tests have shown that the .01% jam isn't harmful to machinery and you may continue to use it.  In fact the jam has improved the overall quality of the finished print.  However, you may have to keep a can of ant spray around.  You may wish to enhance paper
performance by using the 99.99% jam free paper with our new line of 99.99% peanut butter free paper.  They absolutely work best when used together.  Or if you prefer you can save time by using the 99.99% PB & J free paper.  Whatever you choose we are sure you will be pleased with the results. 

In appreciation of your e-mail, we will be sending you a Xerox T- shirt. If we can be of other help in the future, please let us know.","Miscellaneous",3772,4
